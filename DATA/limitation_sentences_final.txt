SEED	NEG	PMC4936958.xml	S20	Objective	NEG	CTCs exist as heterogeneous populations, and assessment should include phenotypic identification tailored to characterize cells based on epithelial and mesenchymal markers.
SEED	NEG	PMC4936959.xml	S14	Objective	NEG	Pain management after colorectal surgery varies widely and predicts significant differences in patient-reported pain and clinical outcomes.
SEED	NEG	PMC4947025.xml	S3	Objective	NEG	The objective of this study was to determine the contribution of lymphatic tissue to heterotopic ossification.
SEED	NEG	PMC4947025.xml	S8	Objective	NEG	We hypothesized that lymphatic tissues play a critical role in HO formation.
SEED	NEG	PMC4974140.xml	S6	Objective	NEG	Survival estimates are usually reported as survival from the time of surgery.
SEED	NEG	PMC4974140.xml	S9	Objective	NEG	CDFS was assessed using a multi-institutional cohort of patients.
SEED	NEG	PMC5069147.xml	S13	Purpose	NEG	Important radiomics features included tumor size and enhancement texture, which indicated tumor heterogeneity.
SEED	NEG	PMC5069148.xml	S5	Purpose	NEG	The institutional review board approved this prospective Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act compliant study with written informed consent.
SEED	NEG	PMC5071295.xml	S52	INTRODUCTION	NEG	CareFirst offered participating practices a one-time 12 % increase in fee-for-service payments for services provided by the practices immediately upon joining the program, which averaged to approximately $10.34 per member per month.
SEED	NEG	PMC5071295.xml	S76	METHODS	NEG	Individuals who had prescription drug coverage outside CareFirst were excluded.
SEED	NEG	PMC5071295.xml	S108	METHODS	NEG	The members who were never attributed to the PCMH model during our study period constituted the comparison group.
SEED	NEG	PMC5071295.xml	S160	CONCLUSION	NEG	Early experience shows that an intervention aimed at realigning primary care practice incentives could be effective in curbing spending growth and utilization.
SEED	NEG	PMC5091627.xml	S103	PATIENTS AND METHODS	NEG	Multiple imputation by chained equations 22 was performed using the MI suite in Stata to deal with missing values for BMI and amount smoked.
SEED	NEG	PMC5091627.xml	S136	DISCUSSION	NEG	In this incident cohort of 5,677 patients with RA, tobacco smoking was associated with an increased risk of mortality.
SEED	NEG	PMC5091627.xml	S147	DISCUSSION	NEG	One of the 2 studies which reported no association, the Early Rheumatoid Arthritis Study 25, collected smoking data retrospectively, and data were missing for 37% of patients.
SEED	NEG	PMC5091627.xml	S179	DISCUSSION	NEG	Former smoking in particular was poorly captured in the 1990s, but there is evidence of an improvement over time 31, 32.
SEED	NEG	PMC5094198.xml	S12		NEG	Conclusion The findings do not support an independent association between vasectomy and prostate cancer.
SEED	NEG	PMC5094198.xml	S46		NEG	The primary outcome was incident prostate cancer, defined as the first recorded date of prostate cancer diagnosis in the Ontario Cancer Registry.
SEED	NEG	PMC5094198.xml	S64		NEG	For each outcome we evaluated the standardised difference according to vasectomy or non-vasectomy group.
SEED	NEG	PMC5094198.xml	S133		NEG	This suggests that those undergoing a vasectomy are more likely to undergo screening for prostate cancer before undergoing the procedure itself, as has been shown previously.26
SEED	POS	PMC5094198.xml	S136		NEG	Some limitations of our study merit emphasis.
SEED	POS	PMC5094198.xml	S137		POS	Firstly, although administrative data provide the advantage of studying large populations, these databases are not designed for clinical research, and some degree of outcome misclassification is likely.
SEED	POS	PMC5094198.xml	S138		NEG	The databases used in this study, however, have been independently validated for cancer related outcomes.40 41
SEED	POS	PMC5094198.xml	S139		POS	Secondly, we were unable to account for possible differences in testing for prostate specific antigen between groups; our results, however, suggest that the use of surrogate cancer screening tests might have accounted for this, as shown by the strong associations between colorectal cancer screening tests and incident prostate cancer.
SEED	NEG	PMC5095976.xml	S52	Methods	NEG	Duplications and deletions were screened by multiplex ligation-dependent probe amplification (MLPA, kit P093-C2, MRC-Holland, the Netherlands).
SEED	NEG	PMC5095976.xml	S68	Methods	NEG	While several transcripts exist for EIF2AK4 the considered isoform is the most common one in humans since it is referred to as reference sequence by NCBI RefSeq.
SEED	NEG	PMC5095976.xml	S69	Methods	NEG	NCBI RefSeq is a database which we used as reference standard for reporting the location of medically important variations.
SEED	NEG	PMC5095976.xml	S108	Results	NEG	Hence, the co-occurrence of both mutations in affected family members is a significant association.
SEED	NEG	PMC5097392.xml	S42	Background	NEG	The majority of these studies have focused on WH subjects as the largest proportion of their cohorts.
SEED	NEG	PMC5097392.xml	S89	Discussion	NEG	In addition, in a qualitative comparison of the difference in differential methylation of CpG sites between AA and WH, many of our results were statistically significant for differential hypomethylation only in AA.
SEED	NEG	PMC5097392.xml	S173	Conclusion	NEG	We also performed weighted gene comethylation network analysis and identified two comethylation modules associated with COPD in AA, one of which included multiple genes related to obstructive lung disease and COPD.
SEED	NEG	PMC5097392.xml	S208	Methods	NEG	Subject level quality control eliminated one sample having 1 % of sites with a detection p-value greater than 0.05.
SEED	NEG	PMC5097848.xml	S84	Methods	NEG	Slides were washed with PBS 3 times for 5 min each, between incubations.
SEED	NEG	PMC5097848.xml	S118	Methods	NEG	To evaluate the differences among experimental groups, one-way ANOVA was assessed.
SEED	NEG	PMC5097848.xml	S156	Results	NEG	Meanwhile, HAE cells (Fig. 6, green line) had also shown a dose-dependent decrease of cell viability with AGE-BSA.
SEED	NEG	PMC5097848.xml	S184	Discussion	NEG	Thus, hypothetically, this RAGE down-regulation noticed in IPF lung samples could reduce the interaction of AECs to ECM and facilitate the basal membrane disruption, resulting in the occupation of alveolar spaces.
SEED	NEG	PMC5098415.xml	S4		NEG	Setting Eight geographically diverse urban regions in Brazil, China, India, Italy, Kenya, Oman, United Kingdom, and United States.
SEED	NEG	PMC5098415.xml	S7		NEG	The best fitting curve was selected using second degree fractional polynomials and further modelled in a multilevel framework to account for the longitudinal design of the study.
SEED	NEG	PMC5098415.xml	S9		NEG	Of the eligible women, 4321 (93.8%) had pregnancies without major complications and delivered live singletons without congenital malformations.
SEED	NEG	PMC5098415.xml	S45		NEG	Tables containing medians and standard deviations of the SFH by gestational age, expressed in completed weeks of gestation (as recommended by WHO International Statistical Classification of Diseases and Related Health Problems, 10th revision), as well as printable charts, are freely available on the INTERGROWTH-21st website (https://intergrowth21.tghn.org; supplementary appendix).
SEED	NEG	PMC5098415.xml	S46		NEG	For the analysis of estimation of gestational age as a function of SFH only, the problem of data truncation at the lower and upper gestational ages was overcome by use of the same approach applied to crown rump length data in the Fetal Growth Longitudinal Study.40
SEED	NEG	PMC5098415.xml	S50		NEG	This process resulted in a total of 814 simulated data being included in the final dataset.
SEED	NEG	PMC5098415.xml	S68		NEG	The standard deviation of the SFH was expressed by:
SEED	NEG	PMC5098415.xml	S72		NEG	Overall, the mean differences between smoothed and observed centiles for the 3rd, 50th, and 97th centiles, were small: 0.28 cm (standard deviation 0.61), 0.04 cm (0.37), and 0.45 cm (0.51), respectively.
SEED	POS	PMC5098415.xml	S89		POS	Another limitation of existing reference charts is that they use uncorroborated menstrual dates, which can cause artificial flattening of the growth curve at term, probably due to errors in dating that overestimate the length of gestation.
SEED	POS	PMC5098415.xml	S90		NEG	The strict strategy for dating pregnancies based on the last menstrual period, corroborated by first trimester ultrasound in all women taking part in the INTERGROWTH-21st Project, shows no such flattening at term in the fetal growth standards.4
SEED	POS	PMC5098415.xml	S91		NEG	The standards we have developed overcome many of these methodological limitations.
SEED	POS	PMC5098415.xml	S92		NEG	Their widespread implementation will allow clinical practice to be unified and comparisons to be made across international studies using a single chart derived from the same low risk population as the other INTERGROWTH-21st standards.
SEED	POS	PMC5098415.xml	S93		POS	One possible limitation of our study is that the measurements were obtained under near optimal conditions—all the dedicated staff taking the measurements were well trained, used the same protocol under blinded conditions, and had no time restrictions to complete the examinations.
SEED	POS	PMC5098415.xml	S94		POS	Consequently, the intraobserver variability in the measurements was probably better than that reported previously.
SEED	POS	PMC5098415.xml	S95		POS	Under less than ideal conditions, the measures obtained might also have been different.
SEED	POS	PMC5098415.xml	S96		NEG	However, our actual aim was to report measures under optimal conditions so that they can serve as a standard.
SEED	POS	PMC5098415.xml	S97		NEG	These international, prescriptive standards, which describe optimal growth, have the potential to improve pregnancy outcomes by reducing the risk of failure to recognise a fetus of small for gestational age through the use of locally produced reference charts that include data derived from high risk mothers.
SEED	NEG	PMC5098415.xml	S120		NEG	Three systematic reviews have assessed the sensitivity of SFH measurement to detect small for gestational age; observational cohort studies show wide ranges of sensitivity from 17% to 93%
SEED	NEG	PMC5098549.xml	S17		NEG	More than 98% of the women participated in the screening programme.
SEED	NEG	PMC5098549.xml	S77		NEG	A prediction algorithm was used for automated scoring by computer (see supplementary eTable 1 and eTable 2).
SEED	NEG	PMC5098549.xml	S96		NEG	Putative false negative fetal RHD test results were immediately reported to the obstetric caregiver for timely use of postnatal anti-D immunoglobulin.
SEED	NEG	PMC5098549.xml	S98		NEG	We scored all samples with positive RHD amplifications as fetal RHD positive according to the scoring algorithm, and all weak or variable cord blood serological results as serologically RhD positive.
SEED	POS	PMC5098549.xml	S222		POS	Limitations of the study are that fetal RHD testing was performed in pregnancy week 27, whereas some countries perform the screening earlier in pregnancy to enable targeted anti-D immunoglobulin prophylaxis on putative sensitising events.
SEED	POS	PMC5098549.xml	S223		POS	More false negative results might, however, occur in the first trimester owing to low fetal DNA levels.
SEED	POS	PMC5098549.xml	S224		POS	Another limitation was the percentage of cases with a missing cord blood typing result.
SEED	POS	PMC5098549.xml	S225		NEG	Our study, however, included almost the entire population rather than a selected sample.
SEED	NEG	PMC5099191.xml	S42	Methods	NEG	Dosages of oral corticosteroids were required to remain stable throughout the study, with the exception of limited, protocol-defined, oral corticosteroid burst (followed by a taper) for increased SLE disease activity or protocol-permitted oral corticosteroid tapering (see online supplementary material).
SEED	NEG	PMC5099191.xml	S96	Results	NEG	The percentage of patients achieving the SRI(4) end point was not influenced by the type of anti-dsDNA assay used (see online supplementary table S2).
SEED	NEG	PMC5099191.xml	S103	Results	NEG	The percentages of patients with at least one adverse event, serious adverse event or adverse event leading to discontinuation were similar across the groups (table 3).
SEED	NEG	PMC5099191.xml	S136	Discussion	NEG	This is not due to a reduced response to sifalimumab, but to a greater placebo response rate; the reason for which is unclear.
SEED	NEG	PMC5099198.xml	S18	Objective	NEG	Our findings collectively highlight pleiotropic roles of MTs as regulators of chondrocyte apoptosis as well as catabolic and anabolic pathways during OA pathogenesis.
SEED	NEG	PMC5099198.xml	S46	Results	NEG	Additionally, MT1 and MT2 protein levels were markedly increased in human OA cartilage (figure 1D) and cartilage of mouse OA caused by destabilisation of the medial meniscus (DMM) or intra-articular (IA) injection of Ad-Zip8, Ad-Mtf1, Ad-Epas1 or Ad-Nampt (figure 1E).
SEED	NEG	PMC5099198.xml	S85	Results	NEG	In addition, MT2 overexpression induced a significant reduction in SOX9, type II collagen, and aggrecan mRNA and protein levels (figure 5D) in association with a decrease in SOX9-dependent Col2a1 enhancer activity (figure 5E).
SEED	NEG	PMC5099198.xml	S91	Results	NEG	Since transcription of these genes and HIF-2α was induced upon MT2 overexpression, we further examined whether HIF-2α and NAMPT are involved in MT2-mediated pathogenic gene expression.
SEED	NEG	PMC5099200.xml	S5	Objective	NEG	Herein, we investigated early temporal bone and cartilage changes in experimental OA in order to further elucidate the role of PAR2 in OA pathogenesis.
SEED	NEG	PMC5099200.xml	S16	Objective	NEG	The expression of hPAR2 in PAR2−/− mice recapitulated osteophyte formation and cartilage damage similar to that observed in WT mice.
SEED	NEG	PMC5099200.xml	S108	Results	NEG	Using an AAV-2/5 lacZ vector, β-galactosidase expression in articular chondrocytes was evident 3 weeks following injection and this was further confirmed by the presence of mCherry staining in chondrocytes and the synovial membrane 28 days following DMM in hPAR2 but not control vector-transfected mice (see online supplementary figure S3).
SEED	NEG	PMC5099200.xml	S129	Discussion	NEG	This may reflect differences in the dynamic responsiveness of skeletal versus cartilaginous tissues.17
SEED	NEG	PMC5099201.xml	S3	Objective	NEG	To compare the efficacy and safety between tocilizumab added to methotrexate and tocilizumab switched from methotrexate in patients with active rheumatoid arthritis (RA).
SEED	NEG	PMC5099201.xml	S6	Objective	NEG	RA patients with moderate or high disease activity despite methotrexate were randomly assigned either to tocilizumab added to methotrexate (add-on) or tocilizumab switched from methotrexate (switch).
SEED	NEG	PMC5099201.xml	S36	Subjects and methods	NEG	n this randomised, controlled study, patients with RA diagnosed according to the 1987 American College of Rheumatology (ACR) criteria less than 10 years before, aged between 20 and 75 years, with moderate or high disease activity at baseline visits, were enrolled between November 2009 and March 2012.
SEED	NEG	PMC5099201.xml	S42	Subjects and methods	NEG	This study was approved by the ethics committee at each site and conducted in accordance with the Declaration of Helsinki.
SEED	NEG	PMC5099201.xml	S52	Subjects and methods	NEG	At each visit, patients were monitored for physical signs, laboratory tests, and AEs.
SEED	NEG	PMC5099201.xml	S54	Subjects and methods	NEG	The primary outcome of this study was defined as the percentage of patients in remission according to the DAS28-ESR at week 24.
SEED	NEG	PMC5099201.xml	S76	Results	NEG	Although the week 8 visit was not compulsory, data were collected for 55% of the patients and analysed.
SEED	NEG	PMC5099201.xml	S106	Discussion	NEG	The CHARISMA study, in which the combination therapy of TCZ was compared with TCZ monotherapy as a part of a dose-finding phase 2 trial in RA patients who had an incomplete response to MTX, also implied that combination therapy was superior to monotherapy;15 DAS28 remission rates at week 16 in that study were 34% for combination therapy and 17% for monotherapy.
SEED	POS	PMC5099201.xml	S119	Discussion	NEG	The present study has several limitations.
SEED	POS	PMC5099201.xml	S120	Discussion	POS	First, this study was not double-blind, and it cannot be ruled out that knowing the treatment might affect the clinical evaluation.
SEED	POS	PMC5099201.xml	S121	Discussion	NEG	However, since an objective index such as the mTSS that was assessed by independent blinded readers could detect a difference between the two groups, this effect was likely minimal.
SEED	POS	PMC5099201.xml	S122	Discussion	POS	Second, the number of patients enrolled in this study did not reach the sample size defined in advance to prove non-inferiority of TCZ switched from MTX to TCZ added to MTX.
SEED	POS	PMC5099201.xml	S123	Discussion	POS	Although the add-on strategy was significantly superior to the switch strategy on the primary endpoint using the DAS28, the superiority in the sensitivity analysis using the SDAI and the CDAI was limited because of the insufficient power.
SEED	POS	PMC5099201.xml	S124	Discussion	POS	Third, the dose of MTX used in this study was lower than that used in Western countries, as in the ACT-RAY study.
SEED	POS	PMC5099201.xml	S125	Discussion	NEG	Since the lower dose of MTX would have tended to decrease the difference between the two groups, this did not appear to have affected the results of the study.
SEED	POS	PMC5099201.xml	S126	Discussion	NEG	In addition, it has been reported21 that concentration of MTX polyglutamates, a potential marker for MTX use, in red blood cells was relatively higher in a Japanese study than in a study from the USA, suggesting that a lower dose of MTX may be sufficient in Japanese patients.
SEED	NEG	PMC5099203.xml	S32	Introduction	NEG	Altorok et al14 report a number of differentially methylated CpG sites (DMCs) in naïve CD4+ T cells from 11 patients and 11 controls, with implications in immune responses and lymphocyte activation, including hypomethylation of IFN-regulated genes.
SEED	NEG	PMC5099203.xml	S34	Introduction	NEG	In order to evaluate the role of DNA methylation in pSS in a comprehensive manner we performed an epigenome-wide association study (EWAS) in whole blood, CD19+ B-cells and minor salivary gland biopsy samples from patients and controls using the HM450K array.
SEED	NEG	PMC5099203.xml	S117	Discussion	NEG	They conclude that epigenetic changes occur in progenitor cells independent of IFN activity.
SEED	NEG	PMC5099203.xml	S119	Discussion	NEG	Taken together, epigenetic changes in different cell types in pSS and SLE makes them poised for type I IFN expression, although the exact mechanisms remain to be elucidated.
SEED	NEG	PMC5099205.xml	S31	Methods	NEG	Patients on arrival are reviewed by the on-call cardiology team on site to confirm the diagnosis and proceed to PPCI, if appropriate.
SEED	NEG	PMC5099205.xml	S65	Methods	NEG	Pulmonary infection was defined as air space shadowing on the CXR or CT, associated with raised inflammatory markers.
SEED	NEG	PMC5099205.xml	S68	Methods	NEG	Finally, patient outcome was determined as all-cause mortality from UK's Health & Social Care Information Centre, which tracks deaths of people residing within the country and registered with a general practitioner.
SEED	NEG	PMC5099205.xml	S85	Results	NEG	The mean age of the included patients was 57.7 years (±15.2) with 397 (69%) being men.
SEED	NEG	PMC5099207.xml	S22	Answer: D	NEG	While other vasculitides can cause aortitis, coronary involvement and presence of subclavian stenoses support the diagnosis of Takayasu's arteritis.
SEED	NEG	PMC5099207.xml	S25	Answer: D	NEG	Multi-modal cardiac imaging plays an important role in diagnosis and therapeutic monitoring.3 4
SEED	NEG	PMC5099208.xml	S70	Methods	NEG	HRQoL estimates expressed on a 0 (equivalent of dead) to 1 (equivalent of good health) scale are necessary to quality-adjust survival and calculate QALYs.18
SEED	NEG	PMC5099208.xml	S71	Methods	NEG	Baseline HRQoL conditional upon patients' characteristics was estimated using data from the three trials reporting EuroQol-5Dimension (EQ-5D) data (relevant studies listed in online supplementary appendix 2).
SEED	NEG	PMC5099208.xml	S99	Results	NEG	Allowing for variations in within-group sample size and covariate mix the results are broadly internally consistent and in line with the published literature.
SEED	NEG	PMC5099208.xml	S117	Results	NEG	This assumption can be justified on the basis of a review of external sources and trial-specific Minnesota Living with Heart Failure data.16
SEED	NEG	PMC5099221.xml	S12	Objective	NEG	The reduction in risk of mortality (HR=0.54 (0.36 to 0.80); p=0.002) remained after adjusting for age, estimated glomerular filtration rate, smoking status, prior cerebrovascular accident (CVA) hypertension, prior myocardial infarction (MI), systolic blood pressure, use of statin, metformin, aspirin and β-blocker medication.
SEED	NEG	PMC5099221.xml	S46	Methods	NEG	A reference cohort of men (aged 40–89 years), without a prior history of diabetes or PDE5i use as of 1 January 2007 to 30 June 2015 was also obtained by random selection, from a search by EMIS, of the same GP records.
SEED	NEG	PMC5099221.xml	S79	Methods	NEG	This is because of the possibility that death and an incident MI might confound each other.
SEED	NEG	PMC5099221.xml	S92	Results	NEG	Fewer deaths (age adjusted) occurred among PDE5i users with type 2 diabetes: 248 (19.1%) versus non-users (1170, (23.8%); 2=12.47, p=0.0004).
SEED	NEG	PMC5099221.xml	S102	Results	NEG	The risk of mortality for those treated with a PDE5i was approximately 40% lower (HR=0.61 (0.45 to 0.81); p=0.001) in unadjusted models and by a quarter lower (0.73 (HR=0.53 to 0.99)) in models adjusted for age, smoking status and statin use (table 2).
SEED	NEG	PMC5099221.xml	S104	Results	NEG	Those with a recorded history of congestive cardiac failure, TIA and PVD had 36%, 40% and 34% lower risk, respectively.
SEED	NEG	PMC5099221.xml	S105	Results	NEG	The association in those with a prior history of atrial fibrillation or stroke was not significant.
SEED	NEG	PMC5099221.xml	S113	Results	NEG	Mortality in PDE5i users with an incident MI during follow-up was also lower (25% vs 42.7%).
SEED	POS	PMC5099221.xml	S145	Discussion	NEG	The study design does carry some limitations.
SEED	POS	PMC5099221.xml	S146	Discussion	POS	There are inherent selection bias issues associated with inferring treatment effects using observational data.
SEED	POS	PMC5099221.xml	S147	Discussion	POS	The observational nature of the design does not establish causality and well-conducted RCTs have the advantage over observational studies by controlling for both known and unknown or unmeasured confounding factors (eg, life course socioeconomic position and doctor selection practices).
SEED	POS	PMC5099221.xml	S148	Discussion	POS	It is plausible that men treated with PDE5is were at lower risk due to younger age and existence of other residual confounding factors that we were unable to ascertain and control.
SEED	POS	PMC5099221.xml	S149	Discussion	POS	We did not have reliable information concerning patient activity levels, partner status or frequency of sexual intercourse, all of which are associated with improved life expectancy.44–46
SEED	POS	PMC5099221.xml	S150	Discussion	POS	Furthermore, data on incidence and prevalence of ED were not available in this patient cohort and we were therefore unable to account for this in multivariate analysis.
SEED	POS	PMC5099221.xml	S151	Discussion	NEG	We were however able to adjust for a number of intergroup differences using several methods including propensity-matching and multiple imputations to provide robust findings.
SEED	POS	PMC5099221.xml	S152	Discussion	NEG	Furthermore, the study has a number of strengths including its size and the duration of follow-up in a demographically stable primary care setting.
SEED	NEG	PMC5099314.xml	S5	Objective	NEG	Factorial pragmatic randomised trial, analysed by treatment allocated, was used for this study.
SEED	NEG	PMC5099314.xml	S15	Objective	NEG	Of 291 pairs recruited, we randomised 145 (50%) to CSP (71% uptake) and 194 (67%) to RYCT (61% uptake).
SEED	NEG	PMC5099314.xml	S47	Methods	NEG	The Outer North East London Research Ethics Committee gave written ethics approval (09/H0701/54).
SEED	NEG	PMC5099314.xml	S94	Methods	NEG	This showed no evidence of bias due to non-blinded researchers.
SEED	POS	PMC5099314.xml	S194	Discussion	POS	These analyses assume that peer support and reminiscence do not interact in the sense that one potentiates or weakens the other.
SEED	POS	PMC5099314.xml	S195	Discussion	POS	However, three of many interactions we tested were significant.
SEED	POS	PMC5099314.xml	S196	Discussion	POS	Hence, we interpret the corresponding non-significant main effects with caution.
SEED	POS	PMC5099314.xml	S197	Discussion	POS	Though we addressed this issue by comparing the combined intervention with TAU, this comparison does not have as much power.
SEED	NEG	PMC5099316.xml	S70	Results	NEG	The prevalence of limb apraxia was highest in PCA (91.7%), followed by almost equal prevalence in amnestic AD and lvPPA (69% and 66.7%, respectively).
SEED	NEG	PMC5099316.xml	S73	Results	NEG	Overall, associated parietal features were more prevalent in the AD spectrum than FTD spectrum disorders, being highest in lvPPA followed by patients with PCA and amnestic AD.
SEED	NEG	PMC5099316.xml	S81	Results	NEG	Since apraxia is a core feature of corticobasal syndrome (CBS),22 which is a pathologically heterogeneous syndrome not fitting clearly into AD or FTD spectrum disorders,23 we reviewed the records to identify whether any patients subsequently developed additional Parkinsonian features suggestive of CBS.
SEED	NEG	PMC5099316.xml	S120	Discussion	POS	Due to the retrospective nature of this study, standardized tests of praxis were not included in the assessment to determine the sensitivity of routine clinical examination, and further research is warranted to examine this.

SEED	NEG	PMC5106055.xml	S94	Discussion	NEG	In our study, the IOP reduction was 19.0%, and the medication reduction was 38.2% at 6 months.
SEED	NEG	PMC5106055.xml	S95	Discussion	NEG	The lower percentage of IOP drop in our present study may be caused by a number of factors.
SEED	NEG	PMC5106055.xml	S97	Discussion	NEG	With a longer duration of disease, the eyes are more hyperemic at the time of surgery, leading to greater inflammatory reaction and a higher scarring tendency.
SEED	NEG	PMC5106055.xml	S101	Discussion	NEG	Therefore, the energy level may need to be titrated and further optimized when applied to Chinese eyes.
SEED	NEG	PMC5106055.xml	S107	Discussion	NEG	Theoretically, the emerging aqueous should have prevented the ablation by the laser, thus avoiding perforation.

SEED	POS	PMC5106055.xml	S117	Discussion	POS	It has a limited follow-up period; however, reporting of the early postoperative results were clinically relevant as there was a transient climbing of IOP between 1 and 3 months, followed by IOP reduction from 3 to 6 months after CLASS, unlike with traditional trabeculectomy.
SEED	POS	PMC5106055.xml	S118	Discussion	NEG	Therefore, it is advisable to avoid early reintervention within 3 months after CLASS surgery.
SEED	POS	PMC5106055.xml	S119	Discussion	POS	The present study sample size is relatively small, in spite of that, statistically significant reductions in both IOP and medications were demonstrated after the CLASS procedure.

SEED	POS	PMC5106055.xml	S124	Discussion	NEG	As visual field loss takes time to progress, it shall be included for analysis in future studies reporting the long-term outcomes.
SEED	POS	PMC5106055.xml	S125	Discussion	NEG	CLASS is a nonpenetrating procedure in which aqueous percolates through the TDM, where it collects within the scleral bed and diffuses into the subchoroidal and subconjunctival space.
SEED	POS	PMC5106055.xml	S126	Discussion	POS	It would be ideal if a postoperative ultrasound biomicroscopy (UBM) was performed to provide investigative confirmation on the aqueous outflow pathway but unfortunately UBM is not a routine practice for posttrabeculectomy patients in our institution.

SEED	POS	PMC5106065.xml	S128	Discussion	POS	Second, a cross-sectional design was used which does not permit inference to state-dependent or trait-dependent findings.
SEED	POS	PMC5106065.xml	S129	Discussion	POS	Third, BOLD signal has a relatively sluggish nature and the hemodynamic delay between brain areas is variable.
SEED	POS	PMC5106065.xml	S130	Discussion	POS	Those issues may confound consistent detection of neural-based causal influences between different regions,[34] although, it has been shown that applying GC on real fMRI data results in sensitive and specific identification of causal influences between tested regions.[27]
SEED	POS	PMC5106065.xml	S131	Discussion	POS	Nevertheless, future studies may want to consider performing GC analysis on higher temporal resolution fMRI data (shorter TR) or using other techniques with significant higher temporal resolution like magnetoencephalography.
SEED	NEG	PMC5106066.xml	S20	Introduction	NEG	Although the associations of sleep duration with obesity and dyslipidemia are well-established, the definition of the appropriate duration of sleep for the prevention or improvement of obesity and dyslipidemia remains unclear.
SEED	NEG	PMC5106066.xml	S57	Subjects and methods	NEG	P values less than 0.05 were considered statistically significant.
SEED	NEG	PMC5106066.xml	S110	Discussion	NEG	However, greater proportions of dietary fat (compared with greater proportions of dietary CHO) can be interpreted as greater consumptions of energy-dense diets,[25] which consequently result in an increase in the risk of obesity.
SEED	NEG	PMC5106066.xml	S125	Discussion	NEG	Therefore, as mentioned by Leischik et al, future studies will need to consider multidimensional factors including the level of physical activity and the types and qualities of foods composing the diet, and also sleep status, in relation to the risk of obesity and dyslipidemia.
SEED	NEG	PMC5106067.xml	S19	Introduction	NEG	The mechanisms of hypertension seen with obesity are explained by hemodynamic alterations (eg, elevation in cardiac output and relatively elevated systemic vascular resistance) and abnormalities in lipid and glucose metabolism related to fat distribution.[2]
SEED	NEG	PMC5106067.xml	S30	Introduction	NEG	Therefore, this time period is important for intervention.[12]
SEED	NEG	PMC5106067.xml	S74	Methods	NEG	We assessed participants’ smoking status, drinking status, physical activity, and eating behavior with a self-reporting questionnaire.
SEED	NEG	PMC5106067.xml	S80	Methods	NEG	The questionnaire was completed on a 4-point Likert scale ranging from “strongly disagree,” “somewhat disagree,” and “somewhat agree,” to “strongly agree,” with higher scores indicating eating behaviors that lead to obesity.
SEED	NEG	PMC5106067.xml	S88	Methods	NEG	Sex difference was also evaluated.
SEED	NEG	PMC5106067.xml	S102	Results	NEG	Physical activity and the scores of eating-behavior questionnaire were not significantly different between both groups (P = 0.24 and P = 0.39 respectively).
SEED	NEG	PMC5106067.xml	S112	Results	NEG	The CCs between IAFA and SBP or DBP were significant in men (r = 0.35, P < 0.0001; and r = 0.22, P < 0.0001, respectively); however, in women, no significant correlations were found (r = 0.05, P = 0.40; and r = 0.06, P = 0.33, respectively).
SEED	NEG	PMC5106067.xml	S122	Discussion	NEG	Several studies demonstrated the relationship between IAFA and hypertension.
SEED	NEG	PMC5106067.xml	S129	Discussion	NEG	Thus, IAF accumulation is associated with high BP at least since adolescence.
SEED	NEG	PMC5106067.xml	S137	Discussion	NEG	Yiannikouris et al[22] compared the adipocyte angiotensinogen-deficient mice with wild-type mice to investigate whether high fat-feeding induces RAS activation and BP elevation.
SEED	NEG	PMC5106067.xml	S145	Discussion	NEG	In the present study, unlike in men, no significant association between IAFA and BP was observed in women.
SEED	NEG	PMC5106067.xml	S148	Discussion	NEG	Estrogens increase systemic blood concentration of angiotensinogen,[28] but reduce the activation of ACE,[29] down-regulate AT1 receptor,[30] and up-regulate AT2 receptor.[31]
SEED	NEG	PMC5106067.xml	S157	Discussion	NEG	Our results suggest that reducing IAF in young may be beneficial.
SEED	POS	PMC5106067.xml	S177	Discussion	NEG	This single-center cross-sectional study of Japanese young adults has mainly 4 limitations.
SEED	POS	PMC5106067.xml	S178	Discussion	POS	First, because the sample size of female subjects was small, sex-stratified multiple logistic analysis (Table 3) failed to show the relationship between IAFA and high BP clearly.
SEED	POS	PMC5106067.xml	S179	Discussion	NEG	We also compared the tertiles of IAFA in women.
SEED	POS	PMC5106067.xml	S180	Discussion	NEG	After adjustment of age, smoking, exercise, and eating behavior, the risk of high BP was not different within the groups (using the value of the lower IAFA trtile group as reference, ORs and 95% CIs of high BP of middle and higher tertile groups were OR 0.96, 95% CI 0.11–8.17 and OR 0.58, 95% CI 0.07–3.59, respectively).
SEED	POS	PMC5106067.xml	S181	Discussion	NEG	In addition, liner regression analysis showed no significant relationship between IAFA and BP in women (Table 4).
SEED	POS	PMC5106067.xml	S182	Discussion	POS	Second, although family history is an important factor of high BP, variables in this study do not include family history.
SEED	POS	PMC5106067.xml	S183	Discussion	NEG	However, in 561 of 697 participants, family histories were confirmed, and after adjusting for family history, the results were not different.
SEED	POS	PMC5106067.xml	S184	Discussion	POS	Third, salt sensitivity is supposed to be involved in high BP with IAF accumulation.
SEED	POS	PMC5106067.xml	S185	Discussion	POS	Therefore, the amount of salt intake can be a bias, but these data were not obtained in the present study.
SEED	POS	PMC5106067.xml	S186	Discussion	NEG	In general, young adults with normal renal function have sufficient sodium extraction abilities.
SEED	POS	PMC5106067.xml	S187	Discussion	NEG	None of the participants had a history of kidney disease or detectable proteinuria.
SEED	POS	PMC5106067.xml	S188	Discussion	POS	Fourth, this is a cross-sectional study, and it cannot demonstrate a causal relationship.
SEED	POS	PMC5106067.xml	S189	Discussion	NEG	However, the present study results suggest that IAF accumulation is a critical risk factor for high BP and an important target for intervention.
SEED	POS	PMC5106067.xml	S190	Discussion	NEG	Further studies are needed to elucidate the relationship between IAF change and BP.
SEED	NEG	PMC5106067.xml	S193	Conclusions	NEG	Young adulthood around 20 years of age is an important time period for preventing hypertension.
SEED	NEG	PMC5106068.xml	S26	Introduction	NEG	Both the above studies examined whether long-term changes in sleep duration and the future risk of diabetes.
SEED	NEG	PMC5106068.xml	S56	Methods	NEG	As sleep duration was measured only in whole numbers of hours, durations of sleep that differed by 0 or 1 hour between successive phases were considered not to be different and classified as “no change in sleep duration.” For these “stable” sleepers, average sleep duration was calculated and categorized into 5 levels: ≤5.5, 6.0 to 6.5, 7.0, 7.5 to 8.0 and ≥8.5 hours.
SEED	NEG	PMC5106068.xml	S68	Methods	NEG	One-way analysis of variance (ANOVA) was used for nonpaired samples of normally distributed parameters and the Kruskal–Waillis test for nonparametric variables.
SEED	NEG	PMC5106068.xml	S84	Results	NEG	Table 1 shows the general characteristics of the study participants according to incident diabetes.
SEED	NEG	PMC5106069.xml	S76	Results	NEG	The mean age of patients with SPTs was 48.8 ± 4.7 years, and the median age was 50 years (range, 15–79 years).
SEED	NEG	PMC5106069.xml	S120	Discussion	NEG	This finding was also concordant with the results of a study by Kong et al,[13] who indicated an upward trend in the cumulative incidence rate with an increasing follow-up duration after 2D-RT; in that study, the mean annual growth rate was approximately 1%.
SEED	NEG	PMC5106069.xml	S148	Discussion	NEG	Other studies have suggested that an increased duration of irradiation, low-dose irradiation, and large area of irradiation might accelerate cancer development.[21]
SEED	POS	PMC5106069.xml	S152	Discussion	NEG	Our study had some limitations.
SEED	POS	PMC5106069.xml	S153	Discussion	POS	Although 527 patients were included in this study, only 12 developed posttreatment SPTs in the irradiation field.
SEED	POS	PMC5106069.xml	S154	Discussion	POS	The above-described time effect on irradiation-induced SPTs suggests that a longer-term follow-up of more is needed and would better support the study results.
SEED	NEG	PMC5106071.xml	S53	Patients and methods	NEG	Data were processed using SPSS 22.0 for Windows (SPSS Inc., Chicago, IL).
SEED	NEG	PMC5106071.xml	S76	Results	NEG	The total incidence of other symptoms including fatigue, cough, dyspnea, fever, and vomit were significantly higher in synchronous group than that of no-synchronous group (P < 0.001).
SEED	NEG	PMC5106071.xml	S82	Results	NEG	The presence of synchronous gastric cancer, tumor size, Ki-67, and adjuvant therapy was associated with poorer DFS, and the presence of age, gender, and synchronous gastric cancer was associated with poorer DSS according to the univariate analysis (all P < 0.05, Table 3).
SEED	NEG	PMC5106071.xml	S110	Discussion	NEG	In addition, GISTs may be misdiagnosed as lymph node metastases during surgery.[21]
SEED	NEG	PMC5106072.xml	S21	Introduction	NEG	With an average diameter of 3 to 10 mm,[3] the small size of cholesterol polyps confounds diagnosis by ultrasonography and other routine imaging methods.
SEED	NEG	PMC5106072.xml	S23	Introduction	NEG	Therefore, choledochoscopic biopsy is essential for the histopathological diagnosis of cholesterol polyps to rule out malignancy.[1]
SEED	NEG	PMC5106072.xml	S48	Discussion	NEG	Cholesterol polyps in the CBD were first reported by Fock[5] in 1958.
SEED	NEG	PMC5106072.xml	S65	Acknowledgments	NEG	The authors thank Dr Yi-Ting Meng and Dr Jing-Jing Yao in the Pathology Department at Beijing Tsinghua Changgung Hospital for their assistance in determining the diagnosis.
SEED	NEG	PMC5106073.xml	S11	Abstract	NEG	Time for the intubation of DLT took 100 ± 16.2 seconds (mean ± SD) in simple maneuver group and 95.1 ± 20.8 seconds in conventional maneuver group.
SEED	NEG	PMC5106073.xml	S59	Patients and methods	NEG	First, after the endobronchial cuff had passed the vocal cords, the stylet was removed, and the tube rotated 90° toward the left and advanced until a certain resistance is encountered; Second, after successful blind intubation, the anesthesiologist inflated the endobronchial cuff with the appropriate volume of air (2–3 mL), observed chest wall movements, auscultated both lungs before and after selective clamping of endobronchial or tracheal lumen, and checked lung compliance by manual ventilation to verify the correct position of the DLT.
SEED	NEG	PMC5106073.xml	S76	Patients and methods	NEG	Group comparisons were based on the results of the independent t test.
SEED	NEG	PMC5106073.xml	S121	Discussion	NEG	The same reason applies to why we inflate 5 to 7 mL air into the endobronchial cuff just after passes through vocal cords during the intubation.
SEED	NEG	PMC5106075.xml	S26	Introduction	NEG	In one of its publications, the General Medical Council describes the duties of a physician with good medical practice as providing good clinical care, maintaining good medical practice, learning and teaching, communication with patients, interaction with colleagues, probity, and health.[4]
SEED	NEG	PMC5106075.xml	S31	Introduction	NEG	In recent years, professionalism has been a widely emphasized subject in medical education and medical practices.
SEED	NEG	PMC5106075.xml	S97	Results	NEG	Age was analyzed in continuous and categorized scale in the relation with knowledge of professionalism, and there was no significant relationship in both scale of age and knowledge of professionalism (P > 0.05).
SEED	NEG	PMC5106075.xml	S106	Discussions and conclusion	NEG	A study showed that cultural similarities and differences have a strong impact on the concept of professionalism in a manner that a universally acceptable concept about medical professionalism is difficult.[17]
SEED	POS	PMC5106075.xml	S134	Limitations	POS	The study evaluated just the knowledge of physicians and medical students on medical professionalism and other aspects of medicine, including the attitudes and behavior, were not studied.
SEED	POS	PMC5106075.xml	S135	Limitations	POS	Although the validity of the questionnaire is checked by researchers, there is no certainty about whether this questionnaire really reflects the true awareness of professionalism among responders.
SEED	POS	PMC5106075.xml	S136	Limitations	POS	The study was conducted in teaching hospitals, and the results cannot be generalized to all hospitals and medical community.
SEED	POS	PMC5106075.xml	S137	Limitations	POS	It must be considered that medical professionalism is under the category of medical ethics and can be different in different countries according to their culture and values.
SEED	NEG	PMC5106076.xml	S99	Results	NEG	In the group with eGFR 15–29 mL/min/1.73 m2, the incidence of PMI of low degree was 16.7% (1 patients) and high degree was seen in 50.0% (3 patients).
SEED	NEG	PMC5106076.xml	S150	Discussion	NEG	Unfortunately, the limitations of that study were baseline inequalities between study groups.
SEED	NEG	PMC5106076.xml	S162	Discussion	NEG	Our finding that BMS is associated with significantly higher incidence of PMI may be explained by higher inflammatory reaction after BMS implantation.
SEED	NEG	PMC5106076.xml	S178	Discussion	NEG	Before these procedures, patients should be assessed for risk of CIN using a simple clinical ACEF risk score as a predictor of acute kidney injury after PCI.[40]
SEED	NEG	PMC5106077.xml	S6	Abstract	NEG	Subjects were asked to rate their perception.
SEED	NEG	PMC5106077.xml	S9	Abstract	NEG	Ability to vary gait speed, perform toileting, and ascend stairs were identified as the most sensitive performance predictors.

SEED	NEG	PMC5106077.xml	S25	Introduction	NEG	In Germany, the individual assessment is a key element and the use of such systems has almost become a standard.
SEED	NEG	PMC5106077.xml	S33	Introduction	NEG	The mobility grade changed from MG 2 to MG 3 in 50% of the subjects and this matched results shown earlier by Kahle et al[11] and Hafner and Smith.[12]
SEED	NEG	PMC5106077.xml	S40	Introduction	NEG	The potential for using such variables as predictors will be assessed and a useful set of performance indicators will be identified.
SEED	NEG	PMC5106077.xml	S51	Methods	NEG	On average, this second assessment occurred after 1 week of use with the trial prosthesis.
SEED	NEG	PMC5106077.xml	S79	Methods	NEG	For stair ambulation, specific attention was given to whether the subject was capable of initiating the stairs function; whether the foot was positioned properly; whether the subject was capable of carrying out an entire stair step; and whether movements were carried out alternatingly.
SEED	NEG	PMC5106077.xml	S106	Methods	NEG	For statistical justification of this approach we refer to Carfio et al.[22]
SEED	NEG	PMC5106077.xml	S108	Methods	NEG	Descriptive analysis was performed using R (Version 3.2.3, R Foundation for Statistical Computing), Microsoft Winstat (Version 2012.1, R.
SEED	NEG	PMC5106077.xml	S139	Results	NEG	The highest subcategory rating is 60.57% (variable gait speed).
SEED	NEG	PMC5106077.xml	S142	Results	NEG	Total responsiveness ranges from 67% to 96% and the highest subcategory rating is 76% for standing on a slope.
SEED	NEG	PMC5106077.xml	S179	Results	NEG	Subjects with vascular disease as an etiology perceive advantages when fitted with G.
SEED	NEG	PMC5106077.xml	S187	Results	NEG	An ischial containment socket (compared to hybrid) does yield a slight reduction when rated with respect to functional benefits.
SEED	NEG	PMC5106077.xml	S195	Results	NEG	This occurs in spite of limitations during advanced maneuvering with both weights and obstructed vision as well as limitations with observed gait harmony.
SEED	NEG	PMC5106077.xml	S196	Results	NEG	Having been fit with a C-Leg prior to the trial fitting with G is associated with higher ratings related to most indicators in advanced maneuvers.
SEED	NEG	PMC5106077.xml	S197	Results	NEG	Increased functional benefits are variation of gait speed, gain of attention, and 5 perception categories.
SEED	NEG	PMC5106077.xml	S215	Discussion	NEG	Responders span the entire range indicated by the variables.
SEED	NEG	PMC5106077.xml	S231	Discussion	NEG	Highsmith et al[26] reported that 14 out of 20 (70%) K3 and K4 transfemoral amputees who received training were able to ascend stairs reciprocally.

SEED	POS	PMC5106077.xml	S264	Limitations	NEG	The data obtained in routine assessments span a large range of observations related to function and perception.
SEED	POS	PMC5106077.xml	S265	Limitations	NEG	They rely in their methodological approach on the criteria set forth by Wetz et al[9] and Drerup et al[19] and Kuhr[21] and error ranges were considered to be acceptable for clinical practice.
SEED	POS	PMC5106077.xml	S266	Limitations	POS	The data do not rely on validated outcomes as recommended in controlled trials.
SEED	POS	PMC5106077.xml	S267	Limitations	POS	This limits the accuracy of the findings specifically with respect to the magnitude of the effects.
SEED	POS	PMC5106077.xml	S268	Limitations	POS	The determination of the mobility grade was conducted according to the procedure specific to each prosthetic clinic individually.

SEED	POS	PMC5106077.xml	S272	Limitations	NEG	The influence of acclimation time had been investigated by Schmalz et al.[30]
SEED	POS	PMC5106077.xml	S273	Limitations	NEG	They report that when transferring from C-Leg to G the biomechanical effects are seen within a few hours.
SEED	POS	PMC5106077.xml	S274	Limitations	NEG	They conclude that if movement patterns do not have to change, laboratory-based tests may deliver valuable information even after very short acclimation periods.
SEED	POS	PMC5106077.xml	S275	Limitations	POS	If new motion patterns need to be learned, then longer adaptation and training phases may be required.
SEED	POS	PMC5106077.xml	S276	Limitations	POS	Acclimation time may influence and hence limit the accuracy of responder classification.
SEED	POS	PMC5106077.xml	S277	Limitations	POS	Routine assessments are conducted in a commercial environment.
SEED	POS	PMC5106077.xml	S278	Limitations	POS	We, therefore, do have to consider bias.
SEED	POS	PMC5106077.xml	S279	Limitations	NEG	A recent work shows that limits to bias in trial fittings were found to not exceed 10% and more likely are significantly smaller.[5]
SEED	POS	PMC5106077.xml	S280	Limitations	NEG	The data presented here seem to be in good agreement with the results obtained from controlled trials.

SEED	NEG	PMC5106293.xml	S6	Introduction	NEG	Genotypes of all reported missense ERAP1 gene variants with 1000 Genomes EUR super-population frequency greater than 1% were determined in 1,900 Behçet’s disease cases and 1,779 controls from Turkey.
SEED	NEG	PMC5106372.xml	S6	Summary	NEG	When these mice are challenged with caloric deficiency, the resulting relative hypoketonemia triggers a marked rise in glucocorticoid levels. Multiple intratumoral immune pathways are suppressed by this hormonal stress response.
SEED	NEG	PMC5106372.xml	S21		NEG	One possibility, considering the sensitivity of intratumoral T cells to their local metabolic environment (Chang et al., 2015, Ho et al., 2015), as well as the marked effects of poor nutritional status on systemic immunity in other contexts (Keusch and Farthing, 1986), is a suppressive effect of cachexia on the T cell-mediated anti-tumor immune reaction.
SEED	NEG	PMC5106372.xml	S135		NEG	The transcriptional findings were recapitulated in the PDA model system (Figures 7A and 7B).
SEED	NEG	PMC5106372.xml	S189		NEG	MetaCore enrichment analyses gated on the significantly (FDR < 0.05) up- and downregulated genes were also performed using MetaCore’s pathway maps database.
SEED	NEG	PMC5106373.xml	S8	Summary	NEG	We also find that PHD activity is decreased in patients with homozygous germline mutations in lipoic acid synthesis, leading to HIF1 activation.
SEED	NEG	PMC5106373.xml	S35		NEG	Both PHD2 (the main PHD enzyme responsible for prolyl hydroxylation of HIF1α) and VHL were identified in the screen, validating our genetic approach (Figures 1E and 1F).
SEED	NEG	PMC5106373.xml	S38		NEG	As this complex requires lipoylation (conjugation with lipoate, the conjugate base of lipoic acid) within the mitochondria by LIAS on the E2 subunit (dihydrolipoyl succinyltransferase [DLST]) for catalytic activity (Figures 1G and S2B), we hypothesized that LIAS and OGDH might regulate HIF1α through a common mechanism.
SEED	NEG	PMC5106373.xml	S181		NEG	The Z-loxP-mCherry gene-trap retrovirus was produced as for the lentivirus supernatants but with the appropriate packaging vectors (pMD.Gag.Pol and pMD.VSVG).
SEED	NEG	PMC5109770.xml	S15	Background	NEG	5.32 ± 0.07, respectively; p p < 0.001).
SEED	NEG	PMC5109770.xml	S24	Background	NEG	Indeed, the repetitive inflation-deflation caused by positive-pressure ventilation may provoke a specific response by the ASM, which is known to be adversely affected by mechanical strain (especially high-amplitude strain) [3, 4].
SEED	NEG	PMC5109770.xml	S60	Methods	NEG	These two subphases mimic the increase in insufflated volume during volume-assisted ventilation, and thus limited the risk of over-distension and disruption of the bronchial tissue.
SEED	NEG	PMC5109770.xml	S74	Methods	NEG	Indomethacin was dissolved in pure ethanol and then diluted in PSS.
SEED	NEG	PMC5109770.xml	S79	Methods	NEG	Individual fluid samples were assayed using specific ELISAs for stable excretory LTE4, PGE2, and TNFα (Cayman Chemical Company, Ann Arbor, MI, USA), IL-8 and IL-10 (R&D Systems Inc., Minneapolis, MN, USA).
SEED	NEG	PMC5109770.xml	S126	Results	NEG	In contrast, blocking the inward-rectifier K+ channel and the calcium-activated large conductance K+ channels by applying 10 μM tertiapin significantly decreased the late post-stretching increase in bronchial tone (Table 1).
SEED	NEG	PMC5109770.xml	S134	Results	NEG	Moreover, cyclic stretching of the same human bronchi did not significantly change the levels of LTE4, PGE2, IL-8, IL-10 and TNFα in the organ bath fluid, relative to controls (Fig. 4).
SEED	NEG	PMC5109770.xml	S145	Discussion	NEG	In the present study, none of the contractile mediators of mechanotransduction was involved in the stretching-induced rise in bronchial tone.
SEED	NEG	PMC5109770.xml	S155	Discussion	NEG	The low-force strain was enough to increase the stiffness of the bronchial ring during our dynamic and cyclic stretching, as suggested by Norris et al..
SEED	NEG	PMC5109770.xml	S165	Discussion	NEG	The post-stretching increase in bronchial tone may result from ASM stiffness or impaired bronchial relaxation.
SEED	POS	PMC5109770.xml	S180	Discussion	NEG	Our study had strengths and limitations.
SEED	POS	PMC5109770.xml	S181	Discussion	NEG	One notable strength relates to the use of a tension corresponding to each bronchial segment’s intrinsic properties.
SEED	POS	PMC5109770.xml	S182	Discussion	NEG	Stretching the human bronchial rings with excessive tension would doubtless have generated different results.
SEED	POS	PMC5109770.xml	S183	Discussion	NEG	A second strength relates to the use of freshly human isolated bronchi.
SEED	POS	PMC5109770.xml	S184	Discussion	NEG	This is of real importance because there are interspecies differences in the modulation of airway tone and responsiveness [23].
SEED	POS	PMC5109770.xml	S185	Discussion	POS	However, we cannot rule out the possibility that bronchi from patients undergoing thoracic surgery may have been stretched during the surgical procedure.
SEED	POS	PMC5109770.xml	S186	Discussion	POS	Due to ethical considerations, surgical specimens from healthy non-smokers are extremely scarce and so specific analysis of this material could not be performed.
SEED	POS	PMC5109770.xml	S187	Discussion	POS	Moreover, further studies should focus the effects of cyclic stretch at higher frequency.
SEED	POS	PMC5109770.xml	S188	Discussion	POS	Another study limitation relates to the fact that we did not measure the ring’s diameter during cyclic stretching; this would have enabled us to model the induced strain.
SEED	POS	PMC5109770.xml	S189	Discussion	POS	Furthermore, the short time between stretching and mRNA extraction may have restricted our investigation to very early genes that were up- or down-regulated by cyclic stretching.
SEED	POS	PMC5109770.xml	S190	Discussion	POS	Lastly, as is the case with other isolated organ models, our experiments were performed under non-aerated conditions and in the absence of surfactant, which could have promoted bronchial narrowing.
SEED	NEG	PMC5109770.xml	S193	Conclusions	NEG	Although pro-inflammatory components (in either the cytosol or the organ bath) did not seem to be involved in this response to low-frequency, low-force cyclic stretching, interaction between epithelium and ASM emerged as a major factor.
SEED	NEG	PMC5109771.xml	S97	Methods	NEG	In the measurement of ventilation, periods during which the mouse moved (e.g., sniffing, grooming, and licking) were excluded, but these periods were counted as locomotor activity (% period) in mice tethered with the EEG device.
SEED	POS	PMC5109771.xml	S164	Discussion	NEG	Nonetheless, the conclusion that modafinil does not promote respiration remains robust regardless of the experimental limitations.
SEED	NEG	PMC5109788.xml	S7	Background	NEG	A severe asthma EHR reference cohort was established.
SEED	NEG	PMC5109788.xml	S16	Background	NEG	Asthma is a common but complex heterogeneous chronic inflammatory disease of the airways, which presents with variable symptoms of cough, breathlessness, and wheeze, with episodic acute worsening of symptoms known as exacerbations, particularly in severe asthma [1].
SEED	NEG	PMC5109788.xml	S31	Background	NEG	Some countries have invested substantially in such registries; for example, Sweden’s ‘national quality registers’ include more than 100 disease conditions on a national scale and collect high quality data with coverage that may be near 100% of all cases for some of these conditions [10].
SEED	NEG	PMC5109788.xml	S37	Background	NEG	However, because these data systems were developed for administrative purposes they often lack quality and adequate measures needed for clinical research.
SEED	NEG	PMC5109788.xml	S38	Background	NEG	Moreover, claims data in many countries are limited to patients that can afford health insurance thereby creating a socio-economic bias [13].
SEED	NEG	PMC5109788.xml	S41	Background	NEG	One such example is the use of EHR data to create a real-world reference population of patients to supplement the control/placebo group in long-term studies of severe diseases.
SEED	NEG	PMC5109788.xml	S47	Methods	NEG	Thirty-six centres and one university hospital were included, with a catchment area covering 4% of the Swedish population.
SEED	NEG	PMC5109788.xml	S58	Methods	NEG	Selection of patients from the EHR base population into the EHR study cohort consisted of a two-step approach: We first extracted data from EHRs (n = 33890) and sent it to the Swedish National Board of Health and Welfare, which linked this database to the pre-defined national registers (e.g., patient, prescription of drug, and cause of death registries) [16] (Fig. 1).
SEED	NEG	PMC5109788.xml	S62	Methods	NEG	A total of 452 patients were randomly assigned (1:1) to one of two dosing regimen groups and further randomised (2:1) to receive tralokinumab or placebo.
SEED	NEG	PMC5109788.xml	S74	Methods	NEG	Lung function was determined by spirometry and expressed as the percent of predicted normal forced expiratory volume in one-second (FEV1).
SEED	NEG	PMC5109788.xml	S81	Methods	NEG	We used a weighted Poisson regression model including age to estimate the exacerbation rate.

SEED	NEG	PMC5109788.xml	S91	Methods	NEG	If the patient were eligible at more than one time point, one of the time points was randomly selected as the index date.
SEED	NEG	PMC5109788.xml	S94	Results	NEG	The patients in the EHR study cohort were more likely to be in GINA 5, 42.1% compared to 17.1% in the RCT study population and had on average 3.0 exacerbations during the 12 months preceding the index date compared to 2.6 in the RCT population.
SEED	NEG	PMC5109788.xml	S100	Results	NEG	The one year exacerbation rate in the placebo group of the RCT was 0.9 [95% CI 0.76, 1.08] and 1.86 [95% CI 1.70, 2.05] in the EHR study population.
SEED	NEG	PMC5109788.xml	S104	Results	NEG	Only 74 EHR patients had spirometry performed during the 1-year post-index period.
SEED	NEG	PMC5109788.xml	S108	Results	NEG	In the EHR population FEV1 was observed as part of routine spirometry as needed by the treating physician and hence not all patients in the EHR population have any observations on FEV1 during the 12-months post index period and those who do have one or perhaps two observations (Appendix 1).
SEED	POS	PMC5109788.xml	S139	Discussion	NEG	There are several important assumptions that underpin the analysis.
SEED	POS	PMC5109788.xml	S140	Discussion	POS	Firstly, the inclusion and exclusion criteria need to be equivalent.
SEED	POS	PMC5109788.xml	S141	Discussion	POS	In the RCT placebo cohort, we had the opportunity to assess pre-randomization variables according to a specific protocol.
SEED	POS	PMC5109788.xml	S142	Discussion	POS	In the EHR cohort, the corresponding criteria had to be operationalized based on routinely available observations recorded in the EHR.
SEED	POS	PMC5109788.xml	S143	Discussion	POS	Therefore, the inclusion criteria may not be equivalent, which may lead to systematic differences in the RCT and EHR population.
SEED	POS	PMC5109788.xml	S144	Discussion	POS	Secondly, we assumed that the RCT study population was a random sample conditional on the patient characteristics used to estimate the weights that we used to create the EHR reference.
SEED	POS	PMC5109788.xml	S145	Discussion	NEG	This is equivalent to the assumption of “no unobserved” confounders commonly used in epidemiology.
SEED	POS	PMC5109788.xml	S146	Discussion	POS	Although capturing data on the most obvious confounding variables, such as the number of pre-index exacerbations, pre index GINA classification and spirometry, we cannot be certain that there are no unobserved confounders.
SEED	POS	PMC5109788.xml	S147	Discussion	POS	The analysis technique used here is also not able to adjust for the notion of a placebo effect arising from the very participation in an RCT.
SEED	POS	PMC5109788.xml	S148	Discussion	POS	Furthermore, we must assume that the outcome measure is recorded in the same way in the RCT and EHR population.
SEED	POS	PMC5109788.xml	S149	Discussion	POS	Exacerbations are partly defined as increased acute use of OCS, which is difficult to distinguish from continuous use based on the drug dispense registry.
SEED	POS	PMC5109788.xml	S150	Discussion	POS	Lastly, the results for the RCT placebo cohort used in this study were taken from a large multicentre trial with patients from 16 countries not including Sweden.
SEED	POS	PMC5109788.xml	S151	Discussion	POS	The EHR data used comes from primary care centres in Sweden.
SEED	POS	PMC5109788.xml	S152	Discussion	POS	Asthma care in most countries generally follows international guidelines [23] but asthma prevalence [25], as well as the placebo exacerbation rate in trials, are known to vary among countries [26].
SEED	POS	PMC5109788.xml	S153	Discussion	POS	These observations may make it difficult to relate a global RCT to a population in a single country that was in this case not even represented in the trial.
SEED	POS	PMC5109788.xml	S154	Discussion	POS	Another potential limitation when using EHR data for creating a reference group is the risk of overestimating the treatment effect.
SEED	POS	PMC5109788.xml	S155	Discussion	NEG	This is due to the fact that in RCTs there is often an improvement in the control groups because the patients have improved asthma care due to regular visits.
SEED	POS	PMC5109788.xml	S156	Discussion	POS	Thus the effect in the treatment group is combination of the improved asthma care and the drug treatment.
SEED	POS	PMC5109788.xml	S157	Discussion	NEG	This limitation is supported by the fact that the prevalence of exacerbations was higher in the EHR groups than the RCT control group.
SEED	NEG	PMC5109788.xml	S161	Discussion	NEG	Moreover, our results support the opportunities to conduct registry-based trials or so-called mixed trials where a placebo cohort can prospectively go alongside a RCT study especially in disease areas where it is problematic to assign patients to placebo treatment.
SEED	NEG	PMC5109788.xml	S166	Discussion	NEG	For the future, the PACEHR approach would render important value like for example long term safety study for asthma in which the patient is receiving a biologic agent in development, a control group is simply not be feasible, or for other diseases like atopic dermatitis.
SEED	NEG	PMC5109821.xml	S24	Key messages	NEG	What are the precise trends in COPD admissions triggers and management and outcomes ?
SEED	NEG	PMC5109821.xml	S74	Methods	NEG	Due to large disparities of age-distribution between regions, age-standardized maps were built and these data were subsequently implemented in all statistical models where regions were used.
SEED	NEG	PMC5109821.xml	S141	Discussion	NEG	Nonetheless, since 2007, a three-pronged quality control approach is applied to all dossiers (involving the coding doctor in charge of the patient, the dedicated doctor of the institution and the payer), which is the reason why we started our analysis at this period.
SEED	NEG	PMC5109821.xml	S165	Discussion	POS	Third, variations in Influenza or Streptococcus pneumonia vaccines effectiveness cannot be specifically addressed.

SEED	NEG	PMC5112178.xml	S10		NEG	Key pretreatment predictors of live birth were the woman’s age (31 v 37 years; adjusted odds ratio 1.66, 95% confidence interval 1.62 to 1.71) and duration of infertility (3 v 6 years; 1.09, 1.08 to 1.10).
SEED	NEG	PMC5112178.xml	S13		NEG	If she then has five eggs collected in her first complete cycle followed by a single cleavage stage embryo transfer (with no embryos left for freezing) her chances change to 28% and 56%, respectively.

SEED	NEG	PMC5112178.xml	S21		NEG	However, cumulative livebirth rates are often reported either as one overall average rate or stratified by the woman’s age or type of infertility at a national or IVF clinic level.7 8 9 10 11
SEED	NEG	PMC5112178.xml	S24		NEG	No such model currently exists.
SEED	NEG	PMC5112178.xml	S56		NEG	A manual backward selection process was used to determine the final multivariable discrete time logistic regression model to predict live birth over successive complete cycles of IVF or ICSI.
SEED	NEG	PMC5112178.xml	S61		NEG	Since IVF centres have varying success rates, we also considered a random intercept for the effect of IVF centre as recommended in recent studies.19 20
SEED	NEG	PMC5112178.xml	S62		NEG	To quantify variation between centres, we calculated the 95% range for centre effect.
SEED	NEG	PMC5112178.xml	S65		NEG	Single imputation was performed for those predictors with missing information.
SEED	NEG	PMC5112178.xml	S69		NEG	The adequacy is the proportion of the total explained variation in the outcome that is explained by the individual predictor.22
SEED	NEG	PMC5112178.xml	S101		NEG	With increasing woman’s age the odds of a live birth over six complete cycles decreased (31 v 37 years; adjusted odds ratio 1.66, 95% confidence interval 1.62 to 1.71).
SEED	NEG	PMC5112178.xml	S105		NEG	Couples who underwent ICSI had a 24% increased chance of a live birth than those who underwent IVF.
SEED	NEG	PMC5112178.xml	S114		NEG	The optimism adjusted calibration slope in both models was almost one (0.996 and 0.998, respectively) suggesting no overfitting of predictor effects.
SEED	NEG	PMC5112178.xml	S130		NEG	In centres with low birth rates (2.5th centile of the random effect distribution), the odds of a live birth were 0.61 times that of the average, whereas in centres with high livebirth rates (97.5th centile) the odds of a live birth were 1.65 times the average, after adjustment for the post-treatment predictors.
SEED	NEG	PMC5112178.xml	S143		NEG	The livebirth rate for each treatment cycle started using the woman’s own fresh eggs was 25.8% in 2008, and reduced to 25.2% in 2009 before slowly rising back to 25.8% in 2012.25 In 2013 the rate increased to 26.5%.
SEED	NEG	PMC5112178.xml	S145		NEG	Such an adjustment increased the predicted probabilities by up to a maximum of 0.009 (and by a mean of 0.007).
SEED	NEG	PMC5112178.xml	S146		NEG	In our new online calculator (https://w3.abdn.ac.uk/clsm/opis), predictions are computed using the 2013 estimate.
SEED	NEG	PMC5112178.xml	S153		NEG	The post-IVF model revises these estimates using updated information from the first attempt at a fresh embryo transfer.
SEED	POS	PMC5112178.xml	S156		POS	One limitation concerns the effect of calendar time on future frozen embryo transfers in the first complete cycle.
SEED	POS	PMC5112178.xml	S157		NEG	For example, a woman may decide to have a frozen embryo transfer five years after the embryos were frozen.
SEED	POS	PMC5112178.xml	S158		NEG	However, unless there were changes to her uterine environment, time is unlikely to decrease her chance of a live birth as the embryos were created using eggs retrieved five years earlier.
SEED	POS	PMC5112178.xml	S159		POS	Furthermore, we did not adjust for the time between complete cycles of IVF or ICSI nor for the change in predictors with each sequential complete cycle.
SEED	POS	PMC5112178.xml	S160		NEG	The reason for this is because such information is not known at the time predictions are made.
SEED	POS	PMC5112178.xml	S161		POS	We were unable to adjust for other potentially important predictors that were not available in the HFEA dataset.
SEED	POS	PMC5112178.xml	S162		POS	These include body mass index of the woman, ethnicity, smoking status, alcohol intake, and measures of ovarian reserve such as antral follicle count.
SEED	POS	PMC5112178.xml	S163		NEG	A systematic review concluded that women’s age, duration of infertility, number of eggs collected, and basal follicle stimulating hormone level were the most important predictors of IVF or ICSI success.12
SEED	POS	PMC5112178.xml	S164		NEG	Of these, only the last predictor was unavailable in our analysis.
SEED	POS	PMC5112178.xml	S165		NEG	Smoking and alcohol consumption in both sexes have been shown to have an association with IVF success.26 27 28
SEED	POS	PMC5112178.xml	S166		NEG	Although the availability of these potential predictors would have been valuable, the quality and completeness of routinely collected data on smoking and alcohol is questionable owing to being self reported.29 30
SEED	POS	PMC5112178.xml	S167		POS	One of the model assumptions was that those couples who discontinue treatment without a live birth still have the same chance of a live birth as those who continue, after correction for predictor effects.
SEED	POS	PMC5112178.xml	S168		POS	This assumption only applies to women with obvious barriers to continuing treatment, such as a lack of funds, divorce, or death.
SEED	POS	PMC5112178.xml	S169		NEG	However, most discontinue because they have a lower chance of success.31
SEED	POS	PMC5112178.xml	S170		POS	The reason for treatment withdrawal was unfortunately not available.
SEED	POS	PMC5112178.xml	S171		NEG	Studies have tried to discount optimal estimates by the same fixed percentage across all individuals.11 32
SEED	POS	PMC5112178.xml	S172		NEG	However, such an approach is flawed because the chances of continuing treatment are highly likely to vary widely depending on a couple’s characteristics (see supplementary text S2).
SEED	POS	PMC5112178.xml	S173		NEG	By using a modelling approach to predict cumulative live birth we have adjusted for treatment continuation based on the covariates (such as the woman’s age) as available.
SEED	POS	PMC5112178.xml	S174		NEG	Internal validation of the models showed that the optimism in the calibration slopes was minimal (owing to the large sample size).
SEED	POS	PMC5112178.xml	S175		NEG	Because our model was developed using the UK national IVF registry database with the intention of being used in the UK there is no urgent need to externally validate on data from another geographical location,33 especially since IVF practice and policy varies across countries.
SEED	POS	PMC5112178.xml	S176		POS	Before the model is applied in other settings we recommend validation, specifically an assessment of the calibration of the model predictions.
SEED	POS	PMC5112178.xml	S177		POS	In the future, temporal validation on an up-to-date UK database is important to ensure that the model is robust to changes in UK IVF policy.
SEED	POS	PMC5112178.xml	S178		POS	Further work will involve sourcing a suitable database with which to carry out such a study.
SEED	NEG	PMC5112178.xml	S180		NEG	Many studies have reported the chance of a live birth after IVF or ICSI.13 34 35 36
SEED	POS	PMC5112178.xml	S185		NEG	For fertility models, calibration in an external cohort tends to be the more important measure of performance than discrimination owing to the homogeneity of the population being studied.39
SEED	POS	PMC5112178.xml	S186		NEG	Discrimination assessments tend to result in C indices of around 0.65 at best.
SEED	POS	PMC5112178.xml	S187		NEG	However, the C index for both models is, as far as we know, the highest found for IVF models to date.
SEED	POS	PMC5112178.xml	S188		NEG	This might be due to the large sample size, carefully capturing non-linearity, the effect of complete cycle number, or a combination of the three.
SEED	NEG	PMC5112178.xml	S198		NEG	Existing models that only inform the chances of a liveborn baby after the first fresh cycle are not useful because the first treatment does not always succeed.
SEED	NEG	PMC5112178.xml	S204		NEG	We confirmed the reduction in the chance of live birth with increasing age, increasing duration of infertility, and previous pregnancy.13 35 36
SEED	NEG	PMC5112178.xml	S209		NEG	In addition to temporal validation, external validation on national registry data from other countries might realise the potential of our models to be recalibrated (if required) and used in those populations.
SEED	NEG	PMC5112178.xml	S215		NEG	Although the success of in vitro fertilisation (IVF) has generally been reported as the livebirth rate in a single fresh embryo transfer, the increase in embryo cryopreservation has meant that cumulative livebirth rates are more informative
SEED	NEG	PMC5112179.xml	S19		NEG	In our own setting of Kingston, Canada, ankle sprains account for 7.5% of injury related visits, about 725 cases annually, which represents an annual rate of presentation to an emergency department of five per 1000 people.
SEED	NEG	PMC5112179.xml	S24		NEG	The absence of high quality evidence to inform effective management of ankle sprains in acute care settings is related largely to perceptions that grade 1 and 2 ankle sprains are relatively benign injuries.13

SEED	NEG	PMC5114725.xml	S43	Methods	NEG	Spirometry and plethysmographic measurements were performed using standard techniques according to ATS-ERS recommendations [21, 22] previously established and subsequently extended (http://www.atsjournals.org/doi/suppl/10.1164/rccm.200407-948
SEED	NEG	PMC5114725.xml	S60	Methods	NEG	The assessment of the dose–response characteristics to MCH, observed not only by forced spirometry, but additionally by whole-body plethysmography, was chosen because a certain paradigm shift at least in the technical approach of the assessment of airway mechanics is established since several years, albeit the combined assessment of AHR by MCH by spirometry and whole-body plethysmography is not yet well validated and established in its clinical use.
SEED	NEG	PMC5114725.xml	S116	Results	NEG	However, a shift of EELV toward total lung capacity may have an influence on the magnitude of FEV1.
SEED	NEG	PMC5114725.xml	S148	Discussion	NEG	The most remarkable finding of the present study is that the sGeff with a provocation level of PD−40presented the highest diagnostic accuracy (sensitivity, specificity likelihood ratio, diagnostic odds ratios, ROC curves) for the diagnosis of asthma.
SEED	NEG	PMC5114725.xml	S158	Discussion	NEG	In healthy subjects, deep inspirations reduce the level of pharmacologically induced airway obstruction by bronchodilation [45], whereas prohibition of taking deep breaths enhances the reaction to a broncho-constrictor agent [33].

SEED	POS	PMC5114725.xml	S184	Discussion	NEG	The present study has some limitations.
SEED	POS	PMC5114725.xml	S185	Discussion	POS	Firstly, because this was a retrospective study, there is a potential risk that some asthmatic patients might have been under-diagnosed.
SEED	POS	PMC5114725.xml	S186	Discussion	POS	As standard for the diagnosis “asthma” PD−20FEV1was taken and it could well be that a certain number of patients with cough-related diseases should be attributed to the groups of “asthmatics”, if in fact PD−40sGeffindicated a moderate or high AHR, and the subject presented with a low FEF25–75/FVC ratio.
SEED	POS	PMC5114725.xml	S187	Discussion	POS	Secondly, the database from which the evaluation was performed offered only a small number of really healthy subjects.
SEED	POS	PMC5114725.xml	S188	Discussion	POS	It is not totally excluded that some “potential false positive” responses in the non-asthmatic group might have been more prevalent compared to healthy controls, and the differences between the asthmatics and false positive responders might be smaller than with healthy subjects.
SEED	POS	PMC5114725.xml	S189	Discussion	POS	Thirdly, usually a retrospective study looks backwards and examines exposures to suspected risks or protection factors in relation to an outcome that is established at the start of the study.
SEED	POS	PMC5114725.xml	S190	Discussion	NEG	In our case–control study, however, we evaluated individual lung functions within 2 diagnostic groups, and for each parameter the chance to obtain a comprehensive result regarding AHR was the same.
SEED	POS	PMC5114725.xml	S191	Discussion	NEG	Great care was taken to avoid biases for one or the other parameter and confounding factors such as the development of pulmonary hyperinflation or dysanapsis were carefully addressed.

SEED	POS	PMC5116443.xml	S130	Discussion	POS	First, we only conducted a full analysis of all diagnostic criteria in those with an LAX ratio of ≥2, and thus may have underestimated the total number who may have met 1 or more of the other 3 diagnostic criteria.
SEED	POS	PMC5116443.xml	S131	Discussion	NEG	However, this is only likely to further strengthen our observation of overdiagnosis if more participants without this criterion happened to meet 1 of the other 3 criteria.
SEED	POS	PMC5116443.xml	S132	Discussion	POS	Second, a selection criterion for recruitment into the imaging arm of the TASCFORCE study was BNP above the gender specific median.
SEED	POS	PMC5116443.xml	S133	Discussion	POS	Given the known association between BNP and heart failure, this could bias the results towards detecting a higher prevalence of a phenotype that is traditionally associated with heart failure and a poor clinical outcome.
SEED	POS	PMC5116443.xml	S134	Discussion	POS	It could also increase the prevalence of those with diastolic dysfunction, which may in turn affect trabeculation quantification if there is a significant remodeling epiphenomenon component to these measures.
SEED	POS	PMC5116443.xml	S135	Discussion	POS	No previous reports have described an association between these 2, nor is there any evidence of absence of association.
SEED	POS	PMC5116443.xml	S136	Discussion	NEG	However, of some reassurance, we did not observe any correlation between BNP and noncompaction ratios, nor were BNP levels significantly higher in those who met all 4 criteria, suggesting the impact of any potential bias of this is likely to be small.
SEED	NEG	PMC5116532.xml	S8	Background	NEG	Cardiovascular risk was quantified using the QRISK2 calculator (high ≥20%, medium ≥10 and <20%, low risk <10%).

SEED	NEG	PMC5116532.xml	S146	Discussion	NEG	Patients with PD have regular visits to healthcare providers, and so greater awareness and increased intervention in this group could have an immediate impact in a large population.
SEED	NEG	PMC5117496.xml	S29	Background	NEG	The high mortality indicates that the key mechanism of the pathogenesis is not very clear.
SEED	NEG	PMC5117496.xml	S35	Background	NEG	Yet the mechanism by which extracellular histones activate neutrophil is not clear.
SEED	NEG	PMC5117496.xml	S45	Methods	NEG	Goat antibodies to histone H4 were purchased from Cell Signaling Technology (MA, USA).
SEED	NEG	PMC5117496.xml	S184	Discussion	NEG	Extracellular histones in circulation are lung-targeted damage mediators, which can bind pulmonary capillary endothelium with priority.
SEED	NEG	PMC5117516.xml	S20		NEG	The advent of microarrays enabled the measurement of gene expression patterns on a genome-wide scale [8].

SEED	NEG	PMC5117516.xml	S223		NEG	The temporal dynamics of the host response to IAV in blood is strikingly different in symptomatic versus asymptomatic subjects [111].
SEED	NEG	PMC5117516.xml	S248		NEG	It is also apparent that the immune response whilst essential for viral control also promotes the expression of respiratory symptoms and causes collateral damage to the tissues, which in some cases can lead to mortality.
SEED	NEG	PMC5118041.xml	S10	Objective	NEG	Among men, incidence rates increased with age (P<.001
SEED	NEG	PMC5118041.xml	S15	Objective	NEG	Disease-specific survival increased across decades (P<.001
SEED	NEG	PMC5120887.xml	S29	Introduction	NEG	Because LVH commonly precedes cardiac failure in patients with hypertension, the early detection of left ventricular (LV) remodeling could potentially optimize health care for hypertensive patients at risk of developing heart failure.

SEED	NEG	PMC5120888.xml	S72	Discussion	NEG	On MRI, the signal intensity is typically isointense or slightly hyperintense on T1- and T2-weighted images.[2]
SEED	NEG	PMC5120888.xml	S78	Discussion	NEG	Diagnosis of EC is based on histological findings.
SEED	NEG	PMC5120889.xml	S45	Methods	NEG	Thoracoabdominal computed tomography (CT) scan showed a right pleural effusion, mesenteric panniculitis, right upper femoral metaphysis osteosclerosis, and perirenal fibrosis with hairy kidney sign.
SEED	NEG	PMC5120889.xml	S63	Methods	NEG	Antinuclear antibodies (ANAs) were positive at a 1:320 dilution, with no anti-DNA (ELISA) and no anti-extractable nuclear antigen (ENA).

SEED	POS	PMC5120891.xml	S122	Discussion	POS	The retrospective study design may have resulted in missing or incomplete data.
SEED	POS	PMC5120891.xml	S123	Discussion	POS	Due to the inconsistent documentation of cause of death in the hospital, and the association with multiple conditions of mortality in some patients, it was not always possible to summarize and report the reason for in-hospital mortality.
SEED	POS	PMC5120891.xml	S124	Discussion	POS	We could not conduct any further investigation in the fatal cases to confirm the relationship with metformin use.
SEED	POS	PMC5120891.xml	S125	Discussion	POS	Of 11 patients treated with metformin, the dosages were not documented in 5 patients.
SEED	NEG	PMC5120892.xml	S6	Abstract	NEG	We performed a post hoc analysis of 1) a prospective saline infusion study with 12 patients with arterial hypertension who received 2 L of isotonic saline over 4 hours, and 2) a randomized controlled trial with 45 diabetic nephropathy (DN) patients on background angiotensin-converting enzyme -inhibition (ACEi), who underwent 4 6-week treatment periods with add-on hydrochlorothiazide (HCT) or placebo, combined with regular sodium (RS) or low sodium (LS) diet in a cross-over design.

SEED	NEG	PMC5120892.xml	S110	Discussion	NEG	In the present study, we tested the hypothesis that volume intervention would impact FGF-23 concentrations in 2 independent settings, namely in patients with hypertension with preserved renal function and in DN patients.
SEED	NEG	PMC5120892.xml	S146	Discussion	POS	Since phosphate intake was not controlled during the studies, changes in dietary phosphate might have influenced the results, although we did not observe any differences in urinary phosphate excretion or serum phosphate in response to volume interventions.

SEED	NEG	PMC5120893.xml	S41	Subjects, materials, and methods	NEG	In total, 15,126 subjects were finally selected as the study population.
SEED	NEG	PMC5120893.xml	S55	Subjects, materials, and methods	NEG	Alcohol consumption status was also classified into 3 groups: nondrinker, mild-to-moderate drinker (<30.0 g/day of alcohol) and heavy drinker (≥30.0 g/day of alcohol).
SEED	NEG	PMC5120893.xml	S66	Subjects, materials, and methods	NEG	Serum 25(OH)D levels were assayed according to an agreed protocol.
SEED	NEG	PMC5120893.xml	S67	Subjects, materials, and methods	NEG	Overnight fasting blood samples were collected from each participant during the survey, and the level of serum 25(OH)D was measured by radioimmunoassay (DiaSorin, Stillwater, MN) using a gamma counter (1470 Wizard; Perkin Elmer, Turku, Finland).
SEED	NEG	PMC5120893.xml	S68	Subjects, materials, and methods	NEG	The KNHANES study participants were evaluated by the serum 25(OH)D Standardization Program, so the measurement of serum 25(OH)D was standardized to the recently developed National Institute of Standards and Technology-Ghent University reference procedure.[45]
SEED	NEG	PMC5120893.xml	S73	Subjects, materials, and methods	NEG	The participants underwent ophthalmologic interviews, visual acuity measurements, slit-lamp examinations of the anterior segment, refraction checks, and intraocular pressure (IOP) measurements.
SEED	NEG	PMC5120893.xml	S75	Subjects, materials, and methods	NEG	Refraction measurements were converted into spherical equivalents, calculated as the spherical value plus half of the astigmatic value.
SEED	NEG	PMC5120893.xml	S80	Subjects, materials, and methods	NEG	Refractive error was defined based on the right eye.
SEED	NEG	PMC5120893.xml	S91	Subjects, materials, and methods	NEG	The odds ratio (OR) was calculated after adjusting for surveyed year, age, and sex in Model 1.
SEED	NEG	PMC5120893.xml	S108	Results	NEG	Compared with subjects were categorized into lowest quartile of serum 25(OH)D, subjects with the higher quartiles had gradually lower prevalence of myopia after adjusting for age and sex (P = 0.003), which was maintained after additional adjustment for household income, BMI, exercise, education level, IOP, and daily sun exposure time (P < 0.001, Model 2).
SEED	NEG	PMC5120893.xml	S111	Results	NEG	The serum 25(OH) levels decreased significantly according to the severity of myopia after adjustment for survey year, age, sex, household income, BMI, exercise, education level, and daily sun exposure time (P for trend <0.001).
SEED	NEG	PMC5120893.xml	S141	Discussion	NEG	But the active form of vitamin D involved in calcium homeostasis is 1,25(OH)D acting on bone, intestine, and kidney.[79–80]
SEED	POS	PMC5120893.xml	S144	Discussion	NEG	The present study had some limitations.
SEED	POS	PMC5120893.xml	S145	Discussion	POS	First, we used a cross-sectional study design to investigate the association of 25(OH)D with myopia in the target population, in which refractive errors become stable.
SEED	POS	PMC5120893.xml	S146	Discussion	POS	Therefore, the association discovered here may not imply a causal relationship.
SEED	POS	PMC5120893.xml	S147	Discussion	POS	To investigate the definite causal relationship of serum 25(OH)D level with myopic progression, cohort study designs targeting population in the process of ocular growth seem to be necessary.
SEED	POS	PMC5120893.xml	S148	Discussion	POS	Second, refractive status was considered as manifest refraction.
SEED	POS	PMC5120893.xml	S149	Discussion	POS	Because we did not use cycloplegics, there is a possibility of transient accommodative error.[83]
SEED	POS	PMC5120893.xml	S150	Discussion	NEG	However, we tried to reduce the potential for error by having subjects wear corrective glasses.
SEED	POS	PMC5120893.xml	S151	Discussion	POS	We did not check axial length, corneal thickness, or family history of myopia.
SEED	POS	PMC5120893.xml	S152	Discussion	POS	Therefore, there is a possibility that the myopia was of another type than axial myopia.
SEED	POS	PMC5120893.xml	S153	Discussion	NEG	Myopia is associated not only with environmental factors but also with genetic factors.
SEED	POS	PMC5120893.xml	S154	Discussion	POS	Data adjusting for family history may be helpful in identifying the cause of myopia.
SEED	POS	PMC5120893.xml	S155	Discussion	POS	And there is potential of bias in that we use self-reported information of life habitat including physical activity.
SEED	POS	PMC5120893.xml	S156	Discussion	POS	There are some controversies about variation of serum 25(OH)D level by season,[84–86] and the adjustment of seasonal variation is needed for accurate assessment.[87]
SEED	POS	PMC5120893.xml	S157	Discussion	POS	But KNHANES does not provide information about the seasons on blood samples examination, so we could not adjust for seasonal variations in serum 25(OH)D level.
SEED	NEG	PMC5120894.xml	S108		NEG	By EOT (Supplementary Table 2), a change in the levels of tryptophan and dopamine was found to be positively correlated with a change in the RE score of SF-36 (R = 0.22, P = 0.025 and R = 0.22, P = 0.027, respectively).
SEED	NEG	PMC5120894.xml	S113		NEG	After adjustment for baseline history of depression, the baseline RE score was found to be independently and negatively associated with the levels of IL-8 and TNF-α (both P < 0.02) (Table 4).
SEED	NEG	PMC5120894.xml	S137		NEG	Indeed, the changes in IL-8 levels may be associated with feelings of illness or fatigue, as the rate of change in IL-8 was shown to be correlated with the mental health domain in our study.
SEED	POS	PMC5120894.xml	S149		NEG	This study also has some limitations.
SEED	POS	PMC5120894.xml	S150		POS	First of all, the instruments used to evaluate MEH were subjective measurements that patients reported, although it can be assumed that individual differences were uniformly distributed in both groups.
SEED	POS	PMC5120894.xml	S151		POS	Another limitation can be a relatively short follow-up, where an elongated follow-up period might reflect the effect of achieving SVR more clearly.
SEED	POS	PMC5120894.xml	S152		POS	Also, it is noteworthy to mention that during the trial, patients were acknowledged about the changes in their viral load with medications, or the treatment success at the end of trial, which may affect their mood, but this is an inevitable factor.
SEED	NEG	PMC5120894.xml	S153		NEG	In conclusion, our study showed that alteration of monoamine neurotransmitters and cytokine levels in HCV-infected patients may be associated with MEH.
SEED	NEG	PMC5120895.xml	S14	Introduction	NEG	Thyroid cancer is the most common endocrine malignancy, with increasing incidence in most countries,[1–3] and papillary thyroid tumors (PTCs) account for 80% to 90% of all thyroid malignancies.[4,5]

SEED	NEG	PMC5120895.xml	S104	Results	NEG	Compared with the control group, the postoperative PTH levels decreased less in the nanocarbon group, and the serum calcium and PTH levels were significantly higher in nanocarbon group 1, 3 and 7 days after surgery compared with the control group (P < 0.05).
SEED	NEG	PMC5120895.xml	S122	Discussion	NEG	Ultimately, the aim of achieving superior protection of the parathyroid blood supply is accomplished, and the retention rate of the parathyroid is increased, while the incidence rate of postoperative hypoparathyroidism is minimized.
SEED	NEG	PMC5120895.xml	S123	Discussion	NEG	The incidence of mistaken cutting of the parathyroid in the present study confirmed the protective effect of nanocarbon, with an incidence of 1.9% (1/52) in patients in the nanocarbon group, which was significantly lower than that in the control group (15.6% [7/45]).
SEED	POS	PMC5120895.xml	S145	Discussion	NEG	In this study, there are certain limitations.
SEED	POS	PMC5120895.xml	S146	Discussion	POS	First, the sample size should have been larger.
SEED	POS	PMC5120895.xml	S147	Discussion	POS	Secondly, because of the characteristic rapid recovery after surgery and earlier discharge of patients with thyroid disease, the time in 1-month review period could not be further increased (such as increase 2 times in first and second week).
SEED	POS	PMC5120895.xml	S148	Discussion	POS	Therefore, earlier, more precise time-points in terms of reducing parathyroid function loss in patients using nanocarbon injection could not be accurately determined.
SEED	POS	PMC5120895.xml	S149	Discussion	POS	Finally, the effects of nanocarbon on the visualization of cervical lymph nodes bilaterally should be assessed in future studies, which will render the effects of nanocarbon more comprehensive during thyroid cancer surgery.
SEED	NEG	PMC5120896.xml	S6	Abstract	NEG	Creatine kinase-MB and troponin I levels were measured at baseline, 8- and 24-hours after the procedure, while clinical outcomes were followed up for 1 year.

SEED	POS	PMC5120896.xml	S107	Discussion	NEG	This study had several limitations.
SEED	POS	PMC5120896.xml	S108	Discussion	POS	Firstly, use of single blood sample did not allow assessment of the stability of HMGB1 in an individual over time.
SEED	POS	PMC5120896.xml	S109	Discussion	POS	Secondly, post-procedural echocardiography examination was not performed in all patients, which prevented further analysis on left ventricular function caused by myocardial injury.

SEED	POS	PMC5120897.xml	S109		POS	Lastly, our serotypes were grouped based on serotype-specific CFRs reported by previous meta-analysis and it is possible that certain serotypes were misclassified.[23]
SEED	POS	PMC5120897.xml	S110		NEG	If this were the case; however, it would tend to bias to the null and suggests that, if anything, the associations between serotypes and outcomes are stronger than we reported.
SEED	NEG	PMC5120898.xml	S43	Results	NEG	In 49 patients in the MIS group, neuroblastoma was the most frequent tumor (n = 14, 28.6%), and ovarian tumors (n = 11, 22.4%) were the second most common lesion (Table 2).

SEED	NEG	PMC5120898.xml	S63	Discussion	NEG	The MIS should guarantee results similar to those achieved with open surgery while minimizing technical risks, such as tumor rupture.[14]
SEED	NEG	PMC5120898.xml	S101	Discussion	NEG	In these situations, a preoperative multidisciplinary approach involving the surgeon and the radiologist is required, especially in patients with a history of abdominal surgery.

SEED	POS	PMC5120898.xml	S116	Discussion	POS	The proportion of cases of open surgery was high, especially for more advanced stages of disease, such as with neuroblastoma.
SEED	POS	PMC5120898.xml	S117	Discussion	POS	The fact that lesions at high risk for bleeding (e.g., liver masses) were usually treated with open surgery was another limitation.
SEED	POS	PMC5120898.xml	S118	Discussion	POS	Therefore, a multicenter, prospective study with a long follow-up will be required to determine the role of MIS in pediatric abdominal tumors.
SEED	NEG	PMC5120898.xml	S125	Conclusion	NEG	However, there are still no adequate guidelines for the utilization of MIS in the surgical treatment of these lesions.

TEST	NEG	PMC5120923.xml	S50	Methods	NEG	In particular, the OSI-R questionnaire used in the present study was confirmed to have good reliability and internal consistency for Chinese policemen (Cronbach alpha: OSI-R = 0.883, ORQ = 0.908, PSQ = 0.934, and PRQ = 0.909).[11]
TEST	NEG	PMC5120923.xml	S53	Methods	NEG	The standard criteria for the diagnosis of NAFLD were based on the ordinance issued by the Fatty Liver Disease Study Group of the Chinese Liver Disease Association[14]: exclusion of other liver diseases, such as alcohol or drug-induced liver diseases, autoimmune or viral hepatitis, metabolic liver disease, and genetic liver disease[1]; laboratory tests: elevated ALT (>29 IU/L)[15]; and abdominal ultrasonic examinations: increased hepatic echogenicity compared with the spleen and kidneys, blurring of liver vasculature, and deep attenuation of ultrasonographic signals through the right hepatic lobe.
TEST	NEG	PMC5120923.xml	S56	Methods	NEG	Thorough socioeconomic and demographic variables were collected based on interviewer-administered questionnaires.
TEST	NEG	PMC5120923.xml	S59	Methods	NEG	MetS was diagnosed using the New International Diabetes Federation worldwide definition.[17]
TEST	NEG	PMC5120923.xml	S63	Methods	NEG	Mann–Whitney U test was conducted for continuous variables, and a Chi-squared test for categorical variables, which were reported as means ± standard deviations (SD) or frequencies, to compare the differences between subjects with and without NAFLD.

TEST	NEG	PMC5120923.xml	S66	Methods	NEG	Meanwhile, Kaplan–Meier survival curve and the log-rank test were conducted to compare cumulative survival rate on different police assignments.
TEST	NEG	PMC5120923.xml	S82	Results	NEG	The results of the Cox-proportional hazards regression also indicated that, before and after adjusting for traditional risk factors, MOS, HOS, and HPS were risk factors for NAFLD (MOS: hazard ratio [HR] = 1.237, 95% confidence interval [CI] = 1.049–1.460; HOS: HR = 1.727, 95% CI = 1.405–2.124; HPS: HR = 3.602, 95% CI = 1.912–6.787).

TEST	POS	PMC5120923.xml	S140	Discussion	NEG	It is notable that our study examined whether occupational distress was correlated with NAFLD in a police population after adjusting for baseline demographic and socioeconomic variables, which could have clinical and therapeutic implications as well as provide further information to investigators about the underlying mechanisms.
TEST	POS	PMC5120923.xml	S141	Discussion	NEG	However, there are several limitations of our research.
TEST	POS	PMC5120923.xml	S142	Discussion	POS	First, the scale that was used in our study might be a crude measure, although has been validated for evaluating occupational stress.[10]
TEST	POS	PMC5120923.xml	S143	Discussion	POS	Additionally, we recorded OSI-R scores via questionnaires at baseline only, with no reassessments during the follow-up years.
TEST	POS	PMC5120923.xml	S144	Discussion	NEG	Second, considering the large sample size of our study, we utilized blood tests (based on ALT) and ultrasonography as screening tools, which were relatively sensitive, low cost, and widely available to all subjects.[61]
TEST	POS	PMC5120923.xml	S145	Discussion	POS	However, the sensitivity was lower than that of liver biopsy, which is the “gold standard” for diagnosis of NAFLD.[61]
TEST	POS	PMC5120923.xml	S146	Discussion	NEG	Third, NAFLD had appeared to be associated with air pollution and traffic noise.[62]
TEST	POS	PMC5120923.xml	S147	Discussion	POS	However, we did not obtain comprehensive nutrition and environmental monitoring data, regarding the nutritional status, air pollution status, and traffic noise levels, encountered by police officers.
TEST	POS	PMC5120923.xml	S148	Discussion	POS	Thus, it is difficult to confirm the precise influence of nutrition and environmental factors on NAFLD and occupational stress.
TEST	POS	PMC5120923.xml	S149	Discussion	POS	Lastly, the number of female police officers in our study is relatively small (n = 501) versus male officers (n = 6559) and the incidence of NAFLD in policewomen is also relatively low (5.6%), so we just analyzed and compared male data in the end.
TEST	POS	PMC5120923.xml	S150	Discussion	POS	Thus, we could not provide valuable conclusions about the female police population.
TEST	POS	PMC5120923.xml	S151	Discussion	NEG	In view of these limitations, more clinical and epidemiological studies are required to enrich and confirm our findings.
TEST	POS	PMC5120923.xml	S152	Discussion	NEG	In summary, this cohort study reveal that HOS and HPS are independent predictors of NAFLD in a Chinese police population, especially among traffic control police.
TEST	POS	PMC5120923.xml	S153	Discussion	POS	Systematic investigations using more accurate and noninvasive imaging techniques are warranted to confirm our conclusions and to contribute to the development of more suitable treatments and psychological interventions for NAFLD and occupational stress, consequently elucidating the need for regular screening, healthy lifestyle modifications, and stress monitoring among occupational populations.
TEST	NEG	PMC5120924.xml	S38	Study design and patient selection	NEG	All renal-biopsy-patients had signed the research protocol of Renal Clinical Database Establishment when hospitalized, allowing their data for clinical research and the research was approved by the ethics committee of the General Hospital of the Chinese People's Liberation Army.

TEST	NEG	PMC5120924.xml	S139	Discussion	NEG	This study explored for the first time the coagulation and VTE of NS-AKI patients with the MCD pathological type.
TEST	POS	PMC5120924.xml	S140	Discussion	NEG	The study had some limitations.
TEST	POS	PMC5120924.xml	S141	Discussion	POS	(1) Because this study was a retrospective study, the routine tests for many blood coagulation-related indicators (i.e., vascular endothelium, platelet function, coagulation factor levels, and anticoagulation system) and the imaging studies for thrombosis were not available, resulting in shortcomings in elucidating the entire coagulation process of MCD-AKI patients.

TEST	POS	PMC5120924.xml	S143	Discussion	NEG	Further prospective research was still required to investigate the whole hemostatic changes in MCD-AKI.
TEST	POS	PMC5120924.xml	S144	Discussion	POS	(2) Although the PSM method was used to balance the major confounding variables, many unknown confounding variables might still affect the final results.
TEST	NEG	PMC5120924.xml	S145	Discussion	NEG	This study suggested that MCD-NS patients with AKI had a more severe hypercoagulable state, which might be related to the active immune inflammation of AKI that mediates activation of the coagulation system.
TEST	NEG	PMC5120925.xml	S28		NEG	Furthermore, as an important parameter of cerebrovascular reserve (CVR), CBF can be estimated by perfusion-weighted imaging (PWI) MRI.[13]

TEST	NEG	PMC5120925.xml	S52		NEG	All patients underwent routine MR stroke protocol, which included diffusion-weighted imaging (DWI), fluid-attenuated inversion recovery (FLAIR) sequences, PWI, CE-MRA, and DSC perfusion imaging.
TEST	NEG	PMC5120925.xml	S88		NEG	In 4 cases of congenital vertebral artery slim, QMR reported moderate to severe stenosis.
TEST	NEG	PMC5120925.xml	S131		NEG	Liu and Zhou[32] found that the impairment of CVR rather than severe stenosis was associated with a higher risk of stroke, as the odds ratio in the first case was 1.70.
TEST	NEG	PMC5120925.xml	S133		NEG	The results of a previous study demonstrated that embolism formation is positively correlated to the stability of the plaque rather than to the degree of stenosis.[33]
TEST	NEG	PMC5120925.xml	S136		NEG	We found that patients with severe artery stenosis can maintain CBF at a certain level.
TEST	POS	PMC5120925.xml	S141		NEG	Our study has several limitations.
TEST	POS	PMC5120925.xml	S142		POS	First, the sample size was relatively small.
TEST	POS	PMC5120925.xml	S143		POS	Further study including a larger sample on patients with different degrees of artery stenosis is therefore needed.
TEST	POS	PMC5120925.xml	S144		POS	Second, although all images were performed on a 1.5-T MR clinical system, more advanced equipment has been used in other studies.
TEST	POS	PMC5120925.xml	S145		POS	Therefore, it is possible that the diagnostic accuracy of QMR will be higher using more advanced scanners.
TEST	POS	PMC5120925.xml	S146		NEG	Finally, DSA is considered when moderate to severe vascular disease is diagnosed or when selection of interventional surgery is being considered.
TEST	POS	PMC5120925.xml	S147		POS	The subjects included in our study had relatively severe lesions, which rendered us unable to assess mild stenosis accurately.

TEST	NEG	PMC5120929.xml	S109	Discussion	NEG	Blood-induced joint diseases and RA share similar characteristics.[5]
TEST	NEG	PMC5120929.xml	S147	Discussion	NEG	According to the aforementioned indications that the elevation in sVCAM-1 levels is a multifactorial effect, hemophilia A is still a crucial factor inducing sVCAM-1 expression in the peripheral blood.
TEST	NEG	PMC5120929.xml	S149	Discussion	NEG	The latter group of studies that failed to find associations between patients with RA and controls all employed a cross-sectional study design and had examined patients with chronic RA.[30]
TEST	NEG	PMC5120930.xml	S23		NEG	More recent trials conducted in older patients with high levels cardiovascular risk found that intensive glycemic control may, at best, decrease cardiovascular events and improve surrogate microvascular endpoints, like microalbuminuria, and, at worst, lead to increased mortality.[3–6]
TEST	NEG	PMC5120930.xml	S25		NEG	This position statement was adapted into ADA diabetes care guidelines[10,11] which are consistent with those previously published by the American Geriatrics Society (AGS)[12] and Veteran Affairs/Department of Defense.[13]
TEST	NEG	PMC5120930.xml	S41		NEG	Primary care physicians at NSUHS included internal medicine, geriatrics, and family medicine physicians.

TEST	NEG	PMC5120930.xml	S127		NEG	Many physicians in our sample used predefined HbA1C thresholds to trigger discussions about diabetes medication de-intensification, even though they were also aware of patient characteristics important for individualizing diabetes care.
TEST	NEG	PMC5120930.xml	S128		NEG	Inconsistent report of de-intensification practices in our sample may reflect variable physician awareness of existing guideline recommendations as well as a genuine clinical uncertainty over when and how to de-intensify diabetes medications.
TEST	NEG	PMC5120930.xml	S139		POS	Our finding that academic medical center physicians were more aware of the concept of individualization and de-intensification may be specific to our physician sample.
TEST	NEG	PMC5120930.xml	S159		NEG	This recommendation should be framed as a “trial” that may succeed if paired with healthy lifestyle practices.
TEST	POS	PMC5120930.xml	S168		NEG	This study has several strengths and limitations.
TEST	POS	PMC5120930.xml	S169		NEG	This physician survey was conducted in 2 different clinical sites among physicians with different panel sizes, patient ages, and years in practice.
TEST	POS	PMC5120930.xml	S170		NEG	The response rate was very good for a physician survey overall.
TEST	POS	PMC5120930.xml	S171		POS	However, there were fewer endocrinologists and geriatricians in our sample; larger sample sizes of endocrinologists and geriatricians would be beneficial in future studies to determine if attitudes, beliefs, and practices differ by specialty.
TEST	POS	PMC5120930.xml	S172		POS	Also, the academic medical center physicians were likely biased in their awareness of the concept of individualization and de-intensification due to the local emphasis on diabetes research.
TEST	POS	PMC5120930.xml	S173		POS	Because of the nature of the study, a cross-sectional survey of physicians, physicians’ report of knowledge, attitudes, and behaviors may not translate into actual clinical practice.
TEST	POS	PMC5120930.xml	S174		POS	As with all self-report surveys, responses are subject to social desirability bias, such that the awareness, agreement, and frequency of individualizing HbA1C goals and practice of de-intensifying medications may be over-estimated.
TEST	POS	PMC5120930.xml	S175		POS	Also, for physicians who were unfamiliar with individualization, we did not ascertain their willingness to learn about the concept; this will be an important follow-up question in future studies, as it may clarify the extent to which physicians are open to changing their practices.
TEST	POS	PMC5120930.xml	S176		POS	Finally, while this survey provides preliminary information about physician perspectives on de-intensifying diabetes medications, many more questions exist about the safety and efficacy of such practices.
TEST	POS	PMC5120930.xml	S177		POS	Further studies should examine which populations may safely discontinue diabetes medications without adverse hyperglycemic events.
TEST	NEG	PMC5120930.xml	S178		NEG	In summary, de-intensifying diabetes medications is an important concept that has only recently received attention.
TEST	NEG	PMC5120930.xml	S179		NEG	We found that primary care physicians and endocrinologists frequently individualized HbA1C goals; however, in general, decisions to de-intensify diabetes medications were driven by predefined HbA1C thresholds, rather than by individualized goals.
TEST	NEG	PMC5120931.xml	S6	Abstract	NEG	A nomogram for predicting LNM was constructed and internally validated.
TEST	NEG	PMC5120931.xml	S92	Results	NEG	Moreover, about 39 patients will spare an unnecessary resection without missing cancers compared with the strategy that resection on all patients in theory (Fig. 4B).

TEST	POS	PMC5120932.xml	S116	Discussion	NEG	This study has several limitations.
TEST	POS	PMC5120932.xml	S117	Discussion	POS	First, the patients were only from one tertiary hospital, which has a well-organized hospice care team, so the results would not represent the general status in medical facilities but only that in hospitals with similar levels and hospice care teams.
TEST	POS	PMC5120932.xml	S118	Discussion	POS	Second, some sociodemographic characteristics such as education level, marital status, and economical status were lacking in our dataset, so we could not evaluate the association between these sociodemographic characteristics and DNR and hospice care utilization.
TEST	POS	PMC5120932.xml	S119	Discussion	POS	Third, the dataset used in this study did not contain information about comorbidities, so we could not evaluate the relationship between comorbidities and DNR and hospice care utilization.
TEST	POS	PMC5120932.xml	S120	Discussion	POS	Fourth, the results of this study could only be generalized to hospitals with similar level to present hospital.
TEST	POS	PMC5120932.xml	S121	Discussion	POS	Furthermore, some results showed marginal statistic differences should be interpreted carefully.
TEST	POS	PMC5120932.xml	S122	Discussion	NEG	Although these limitations, this is the first study to focus on DNR and hospice care utilization in non-cancer patients including brain diseases, ALS and dementia, COPD and lung diseases, heart failure, chronic liver disease and cirrhosis, and renal failure.

TEST	NEG	PMC5120933.xml	S138	Discussion	POS	For these reasons, the incidence of AIHA may have been underestimated.
TEST	NEG	PMC5120934.xml	S41		NEG	Cognitive deficit further deteriorated, and rivastigmine was therefore added.

TEST	NEG	PMC5120936.xml	S31		NEG	A number of adjunctive pharmacotherapies for HAND have been studied with disappointing results thus far.[7]
TEST	NEG	PMC5120936.xml	S34		NEG	However, these pilot studies were limited by both the lack of a comparator arm and the short duration of lithium treatment.
TEST	NEG	PMC5120936.xml	S52		NEG	Inclusion criteria were HIV-infected adults (≥18 and ≤70 years), established on ART for at least 6 months with a suppressed viral load (HIV PCR <400 copies/mL), cognitive impairment as defined by a GDS ≥ 0.5 attending public sector ART clinics in Cape Town, South Africa.

TEST	NEG	PMC5120936.xml	S97		NEG	We aimed to enroll 54 participants in each arm to account for a 10% loss to follow-up or withdrawal.
TEST	POS	PMC5120936.xml	S152		NEG	Our study has a number of limitations.
TEST	POS	PMC5120936.xml	S153		POS	First, our findings are limited by the fact that we were unable to enroll our original calculated sample due to slow accrual.
TEST	POS	PMC5120936.xml	S154		NEG	However, an increase in sample size is unlikely to change our findings as an interim review by the DSMB determined that a sample size of 65 using the same assumptions as the original calculation have a power of 70% to 90% for the standard deviation ranging from 0.3 to 0.5.
TEST	POS	PMC5120936.xml	S155		NEG	Our GDS standard deviation was 0.53 and 0.39 in the placebo and lithium arms, respectively.
TEST	POS	PMC5120936.xml	S156		POS	To the contrary, the between-group difference of GDS may be smaller than the assumed 0.25 and an even larger sample size than originally calculated may have been required to detect a significant difference.
TEST	POS	PMC5120936.xml	S157		POS	Second, 6 month trial duration could not exclude a beneficial effect of lithium on long-term functional worsening.
TEST	POS	PMC5120936.xml	S158		POS	Third, we cannot exclude selection bias as the majority of our participants were unemployed females with significant neurocognitive impairment.
TEST	POS	PMC5120936.xml	S159		POS	Fourth, all our participants were black Xhosa speaking Africans which limits the generalizability of our results.
TEST	NEG	PMC5120937.xml	S4	Abstract	NEG	Atheroma of the facial artery is an extremely rare disease.

TEST	NEG	PMC5120938.xml	S6	Abstract	NEG	In this study, we evaluated the effects of graft hyperperfusion on the rate of hepatic regeneration 2 weeks after LDLT by measuring hepatic hemodynamic parameters.
TEST	NEG	PMC5120938.xml	S18	Introduction	NEG	Living donor liver transplantation (LDLT) is a well-established treatment for end-stage liver disease, especially in Asian countries with a shortage of cadaveric donors.
TEST	NEG	PMC5120938.xml	S30	Materials and methods	NEG	After obtaining study approval from Daegu Catholic University Medical Center Institutional Review Board and written informed consent from the patients, this prospective observational cohort study was conducted using 36 consecutive patients undergoing LDLT (31 right-lobe and 5 left-lobe grafts) from March 2013 to January 2014.
TEST	NEG	PMC5120938.xml	S38	Materials and methods	NEG	Desflurane and remifentanil were regulated to maintain a bispectral index value between 40 and 60 along with mean arterial pressure and heart rate within 25% of preinduction values.
TEST	NEG	PMC5120938.xml	S54	Materials and methods	NEG	Next, we calculated the ratios of each velocity to 100 g of the initial GW which was obtained immediately after graft retrieval on the day of LDLT.
TEST	NEG	PMC5120938.xml	S68	Materials and methods	NEG	This syndrome is defined as delayed functional hyperbilirubinemia: total serum bilirubin > 20 mg/dL for >7 consecutive days occurring after the 7th POD, excluding technical, immunological, and hepatitis factors.[17]
TEST	NEG	PMC5120938.xml	S71	Materials and methods	NEG	The primary end point of this study was hepatic regeneration rate at postoperative week 2.
TEST	NEG	PMC5120938.xml	S72	Materials and methods	NEG	A total of 40 patients were required to achieve a statistical power of 80% with significance level of 0.05 (2-tailed) and drop-out rate of 10%, assuming that the alternative hypothesis of a 0.2 coefficient of determination between peak PVV/100 g of the initial GW (PVV/GW) on POD 1 and hepatic regeneration rate at postoperative week 2 is true.
TEST	NEG	PMC5120938.xml	S78	Materials and methods	NEG	Simple linear regression analysis was used to investigate the relationship between hepatic hemodynamic parameter values and their values per 100 g of the initial GW on POD 1 and hepatic regeneration rate at postoperative week 2.
TEST	NEG	PMC5120938.xml	S103	Discussion	NEG	However, these studies did not analyze data with PVV/GW.
TEST	POS	PMC5120938.xml	S110	Discussion	NEG	Although several studies have demonstrated the beneficial effect of portal hyperperfusion on hepatic regeneration in LDLT recipients, these studies have certain limitations.
TEST	POS	PMC5120938.xml	S111	Discussion	NEG	In the study by Eguchi et al,[2] several correlations of mean PVVs measured on POD 1, 7, or 28 with GW/SLV at postoperative week 1 or 2 and postoperative month 1 or 3 were found.
TEST	POS	PMC5120938.xml	S112	Discussion	NEG	However, the number of patients (n = 15) was too small to achieve sufficient statistical power.
TEST	POS	PMC5120938.xml	S113	Discussion	NEG	Furthermore, the etiology of liver disease was not consistent (4 patients with fulminant hepatic failure and 9 patients with liver cirrhosis).
TEST	POS	PMC5120938.xml	S114	Discussion	NEG	If fulminant hepatic failure develops in a patient with previously normal hepatic physiology, the amount of PVF to a liver graft would be significantly lower than that of a liver graft transplanted to a cirrhotic patient.[2]
TEST	POS	PMC5120938.xml	S115	Discussion	NEG	Hence, the analysis of a patient group with mixed etiology is inappropriate.
TEST	POS	PMC5120938.xml	S116	Discussion	NEG	In addition, the slice width of their computed tomographic scan (7 mm) for the volumetric study was twice more than ours (3 mm).
TEST	POS	PMC5120938.xml	S117	Discussion	NEG	Another study, which showed the correlation of difference in PVF per 100 g of GW (PVF/GW) between recipient and donor with percent change in GW between time of graft harvest and postoperative month 2, enrolled 22 patients[8] which is still smaller than number of patients (n = 36) in the present study.
TEST	POS	PMC5120938.xml	S118	Discussion	NEG	In addition, the accuracy of volumetric assessment could not be determined due to the absence of description of the slice width in magnetic resonance imaging.
TEST	POS	PMC5120938.xml	S119	Discussion	NEG	A more recent study reported the correlations of PVV/GW on POD 1 and PVF/GW on POD 1 and 5 or 6 with the hepatic regeneration rate at postoperative week 7.[10] However, this study also included 3 patients with fulminant hepatic failure and assessed the hepatic regeneration rate earlier than 2 weeks after LDLT, when the effects of early graft edema on the liver graft are still prevalent.
TEST	POS	PMC5120938.xml	S120	Discussion	NEG	Lastly, Jiang et al's study,[9] which showed the correlations of PVV and PVF on POD 1 and 3 with percent change in GW between preoperative period and POD 30, included only 18 patients.
TEST	POS	PMC5120938.xml	S121	Discussion	NEG	All the above studies standardized only the surgical technique without considering standardization of anesthetic management.
TEST	POS	PMC5120938.xml	S122	Discussion	NEG	To improve the design of our own study, we considered the limitations of previous studies, and estimated the sample size required to achieve a sufficient statistical power, tried to enroll patients with homogeneous etiology, used a uniform surgical and anesthesia protocol, and enhanced the accuracy of the computed tomographic volumetry with thinner slice width.
TEST	NEG	PMC5120938.xml	S131	Discussion	NEG	This study has several limitations as well.
TEST	NEG	PMC5120938.xml	S135	Discussion	POS	Fourth, this study did not evaluate the relationship between hepatic blood flow and regeneration due to poor reproducibility of blood flow estimation using time-velocity integral and diameter of blood vessels.[20]
TEST	NEG	PMC5120938.xml	S136	Discussion	POS	Lastly, multicollinearity caused by the high intercorrelations between the velocities, GRWR, and GW/SLV did not allow multivariate analysis in the present study.
TEST	NEG	PMC5120939.xml	S21	Introduction	NEG	On the other hand, the prevalence of previously unrecognized PAD is 15% in symptomatic CAD.[5]
TEST	NEG	PMC5120939.xml	S49	Methods	NEG	Patients with an average heart rate greater than 60 beats per minute (bpm) and no contraindication to beta-blocker received 25 mg atenolol per orally on the evening prior to the examination.

TEST	NEG	PMC5120940.xml	S141	Discussion	NEG	Our findings indicate that if an accurate diagnosis in made and the appropriate anticoagulation therapy is administered in the perioperative period, living donor renal transplantation can be performed successfully in patients with APS.
TEST	NEG	PMC5120942.xml	S54		NEG	The patient expressed her explicit desire to undergo restoration of the excised breast tissue.
TEST	NEG	PMC5120942.xml	S64		NEG	The 3 ports created for the trocars along the anterior axillary and posterior axillary lines were barely noticeable, and both the patients and the medical staff found that the appearance of the breast in terms of shape, size, and symmetry was satisfactory (Figs. 3 and 4).
TEST	NEG	PMC5120942.xml	S81		NEG	In this paper, we present a novel enclosed laparoscopic technique for LDF harvesting, which offers the following advantages over previous techniques: For the entire harvesting procedure, only 3 small trocar ports are necessary, which greatly minimizes the total size of the incisions.
TEST	NEG	PMC5120942.xml	S89		NEG	Moreover, during the procedure, care must be taken when the dissection approaches the axilla, although the location of the thoracodorsal pedicle is marked before the operation under ultrasound Doppler guidance.
TEST	NEG	PMC5120943.xml	S1		NEG	Statins and risk for new-onset diabetes mellitus
TEST	NEG	PMC5120943.xml	S75		NEG	In comparison 2, the risk for NODM was compared between patients exposed to a statin and matched nonexposed counterparts.
TEST	NEG	PMC5120943.xml	S76		NEG	The matching method and variables used for matching were the same as in comparison 1.
TEST	NEG	PMC5120943.xml	S83		NEG	The risk for NODM was compared using Kaplan–Meier analysis with the log-rank test.
TEST	NEG	PMC5120943.xml	S84		NEG	The adjusted hazard ratios (HRs) of statin exposure were estimated using Cox proportional hazards regression analysis after adjusting for age, gender, baseline glucose levels (per mg/dL); CCI at the start of observation; whether hypertension was present at the start of observation; and level of exposure to ACEi, ARB, beta-blockers, and thiazide-type diuretics during the observation period.
TEST	NEG	PMC5120943.xml	S113		NEG	In comparisons 2 and 3, pitavastatin tended to have the lowest HR among the 6 statins but without statistical significance.
TEST	NEG	PMC5120943.xml	S155		NEG	Particularly in East Asians, there might be a need to be more cautious regarding the intensity of statin use because relatively less-intensive treatments could bring sufficient lipid-lowering and even plaque regression in those populations compared to Western populations.[36,37]
TEST	POS	PMC5120943.xml	S158		NEG	The present study had several limitations.
TEST	POS	PMC5120943.xml	S159		POS	First, the intensity of statin was not considered.
TEST	POS	PMC5120943.xml	S160		NEG	Despite a report on a higher risk for NODM after intensive statin treatment,[35] whether there is a definite correlation between dosage and risk for NODM, as suggested by a recent paper showing an increased risk for NODM even with a low dose of statins in Asian populations,[21] remains controversial.
TEST	POS	PMC5120943.xml	S161		NEG	Previous studies have reported that the mere use of a statin is important for NODM development itself, regardless of the dosage.[8,19,21]
TEST	POS	PMC5120943.xml	S162		POS	Second, the comparative risk for NODM between various statins was analyzed as a secondary endpoint; therefore, it was underpowered, and further studies are needed.
TEST	POS	PMC5120943.xml	S163		POS	Third, BMI was not available for all of the patients and was not included in the main analysis, and BMI ≥ 25 was used in propensity matching and Cox regression analysis in the subgroup of patients.
TEST	POS	PMC5120943.xml	S164		POS	However, considering that the association between BMI and statin-induced diabetes remains controversial[7,21] and that BMI may exhibit ethnic differences (only 4.7% of the Korean population has a BMI > 30, the level at which it is considered a risk factor for DM[8,38]), a different criteria regarding BMI might be appropriate to apply to East Asians, and these findings need to be prospectively verified in further studies.
TEST	NEG	PMC5120944.xml	S31	Introduction	NEG	Herein, we report a case of multiple HAAs in a patient with hepatic HHT in which open arterial reconstruction was effective and obviated the need for major hepatectomy or liver transplantation.
TEST	NEG	PMC5120944.xml	S45	Case report	NEG	The smaller right HAA gave off the A6 (the artery feeding S6), and the common HAA gave off the gastroduodenal artery (GDA).
TEST	NEG	PMC5120944.xml	S49	Case report	NEG	These findings suggested the presence of arteriovenous shunts in the left lobe.
TEST	NEG	PMC5120944.xml	S66	Case report	NEG	Finally, a completion angiogram showed the absence of the 3 aneurysms and that the hepatic blood flow was maintained without anastomotic stenosis or hepatic artery kinking (Fig. 2B).
TEST	NEG	PMC5120946.xml	S56	Materials and methods	NEG	The maximum SPV was calculated, and when spontaneous nystagmus was present, it was subtracted from the SPV of HVIN.
TEST	NEG	PMC5120946.xml	S95	Results	NEG	In patients without facial palsy (n = 22), affected ears exhibited a mean pure tone average of 41.9 ± 17.5 dB, and healthy ears showed a mean pure tone average of 22.3 ± 13.6 dB in the high frequency range.
TEST	NEG	PMC5120946.xml	S131	Discussion	NEG	In contrast, a direct connection between the facial nerve and cochlear nerve has not been reported, even though anastomosis between the cochlear nerve and saccular nerve has been observed.[23]
TEST	NEG	PMC5120946.xml	S138	Discussion	NEG	ENoG revealed more severe degeneration of facial nerve in RHS patients with vertigo than those without vertigo, which consequently suggested the poorer prognosis for facial recovery, even though ENoG values were not significantly different between RHS patients with and without hearing loss.[8]
TEST	NEG	PMC5120947.xml	S20	Introduction	NEG	Widely accepted, surgical resection is the mainstay of the treatment for rectum GSIT invading to the prostate.
TEST	NEG	PMC5120947.xml	S51	Results	NEG	The tumor resected was proved to be GIST pathologically.
TEST	NEG	PMC5120947.xml	S59	Discussion	NEG	Some previous studies have reported the GIST invasive to prostate.
TEST	NEG	PMC5120947.xml	S90	Discussion	NEG	We summarized the characteristics of the primary lymphoma of the prostate, sarcoma of the prostate, GIST related to prostate, and the regular prostate carcinoma (Table 2).
TEST	NEG	PMC5120948.xml	S20	Introduction	NEG	Ooto et al[4] have demonstrated changes in individual retinal layer thickness according to age in the eyes of a Japanese population by an automated layer segmentation algorithm.
TEST	NEG	PMC5120948.xml	S48	Methods	NEG	The mean thicknesses of the pericentral and peripheral rings were measured by averaging the thickness measurements of the 4 corresponding quadrant areas (segments 2 to 5 for the pericentral ring and segments 6 to 9 for the peripheral ring).
TEST	NEG	PMC5120948.xml	S49	Methods	NEG	Total macular thickness of all areas within the ETDRS grid was automatically calculated by summation of the 9 sectors.
TEST	NEG	PMC5120948.xml	S87	Discussion	NEG	Thus, we can assume that the densities of bipolar cells, amacrine cells, horizontal cells, and Muller cells are likely high in these areas.
TEST	NEG	PMC5120949.xml	S82	Results	NEG	The average diameter was 3.4 cm (range: 2.0–6.9 cm).
TEST	POS	PMC5120949.xml	S181	Conclusions	NEG	Additionally, more researches and development to optimize stent graft designs for endovascular purpose are required to break the present limitations.
TEST	NEG	PMC5120950.xml	S23	Introduction	NEG	Although several different methods have been suggested to solve this air leakage problem, they all have numerous disadvantages, including increasing both the cost and time required to perform surgery.
TEST	NEG	PMC5120950.xml	S24	Introduction	NEG	To solve this problem, we devised the novel technique described below and tested its effectiveness in treating wound patients over a period of 2 years.
TEST	NEG	PMC5120950.xml	S47	Discussion	NEG	Vacuum-assisted wound closure was first described by Argenta and Morykwas[1] and Morykwas et al[3] in 1997.
TEST	NEG	PMC5120950.xml	S58	Discussion	NEG	Based on our satisfactory experience, we feel this newly described technique warrants widespread use in treating wounds.
TEST	NEG	PMC5120951.xml	S15	Introduction	NEG	Coronary artery fistula is a congenital or acquired abnormality of coronary anatomy which consists of connections between a coronary artery and cardiac chambers, a coronary vessel, or an intrathoracic vessel.[1]
TEST	NEG	PMC5120951.xml	S24	Case report	NEG	Transthoracic echocardiography was performed demonstrating normal left ventricular size and function, normal wall motion, and no pericardial effusion.
TEST	NEG	PMC5120951.xml	S29	Case report	NEG	The huge mass was resected and the proximal and distal openings of the giant aneurysm were ligated.
TEST	NEG	PMC5120951.xml	S36	Discussion	NEG	Coronary artery aneurysms and fistulas are not uncommon in clinical practice by angiography, coronary artery aneurysms are detected in 0.15% to 4.9% of patients who undergo coronary angiography,[3] and coronary artery fistulas are detected in about 0.1% patients.[4]
TEST	NEG	PMC5120952.xml	S35	Introduction	NEG	For instance, Kazui et al[18] used a story paradigm in which AD patients heard a neutral story and an emotional story describing a child badly hurt in an automobile accident; recall was better for the emotional than for the neutral story.
TEST	NEG	PMC5120952.xml	S39	Introduction	NEG	Taken together, these studies suggest that emotion may alleviate AD-related memory decline, an effect that may also concern flashbulb memories as they are laden with emotional weight.
TEST	NEG	PMC5120952.xml	S42	Introduction	NEG	AD patients were also asked to rate their emotions about the attacks.
TEST	NEG	PMC5120952.xml	S174	Discussion	NEG	Another finding was the negative emotional valence and states that were reported by Madame F for the attacks.
TEST	NEG	PMC5120953.xml	S52	Materials and methods	NEG	All patients received a 0.5 to 3.5-year follow-up by outpatient or telephone, with an average follow-up period of 2.5 years.
TEST	NEG	PMC5120953.xml	S59	Results	NEG	Changes of symptoms were associated with the course of disease; patients with relatively shorter disease course were shown to have a mild Hoffman grading, whereas patients with relatively longer disease course were indicated to have a severe Hoffman grading.
TEST	NEG	PMC5120953.xml	S84	Discussion	NEG	TCS caused by different causes may have different curative effects following surgical treatment, for example, if TCS is induced by simply thickening filum terminale, the removal of filum terminale can get better operation results; if it is caused by myelomeningocele, which are usually combined with spina bifida, the operation is relatively complex and surgery is needed to be operated as soon as possible to protect the neurological function, the most important is to suture the dura completely and prevent further TCS.[2]
TEST	NEG	PMC5120953.xml	S93	Discussion	NEG	Klekamp[14] advocated that for small lipoma and cone did not show obvious compression, the symptom is mainly caused by tethered, simply releasing of the tethered is suitable to prevent postoperative adhesion and not to destroy lipoma; and for larger lipoma compressed the conus medullaris, decreasing the volume of lipoma from internal, retaining the capsule, and sewing up the incision will be more effective to reduce the possibility of adhesion.
TEST	NEG	PMC5120954.xml	S67	Case report	NEG	The color ultrasound follow-up at 6 months after surgery confirmed that the blood flow of the bilateral renal arteries and the superior mesenteric artery was smooth, with no endoleaks of the aneurysm.
TEST	NEG	PMC5120954.xml	S85	Discussion	NEG	Previously, existing studies had described in detail how to carry out physician modification and fenestration in a stent graft body.[9]
TEST	NEG	PMC5120954.xml	S87	Discussion	NEG	The anchoring structure of the Gore Excluder was designed in a range of 9 mm around the proximal end of the stent graft.
TEST	NEG	PMC5120954.xml	S95	Discussion	NEG	The fenestration position can be observed in the fluoroscopy image.
TEST	NEG	PMC5120955.xml	S7	Abstract	NEG	The SUVmax of the primary tumors was >2.0 and the SUVmax of the mediastinal LN stations ranged from 2.0 to 7.0 on PET/CT.
TEST	NEG	PMC5120955.xml	S15	Abstract	NEG	SUVindex may be a predictor of mediastinal LN malignancy in lung cancer patients.
TEST	NEG	PMC5120955.xml	S29	Introduction	NEG	We also evaluated the abilities of these parameters to predict LN malignancy among smokers and nonsmokers, respectively.
TEST	NEG	PMC5120955.xml	S59	Methods	NEG	We define SUVn/t as LN SUVmax divided by primary tumor SUVmax; SUVindex was defined as SUVn/t multiply by primary tumor largest dimension.
TEST	NEG	PMC5120956.xml	S22	Introduction	NEG	Compensatory TL/L curve is believed to have a great impact on surgical outcomes in patients with IS.[7,8]
TEST	NEG	PMC5120956.xml	S29	Data and methods	NEG	The research protocol was approved by the Ethics Committee of Changhai Hospital (Shanghai, China).
TEST	NEG	PMC5120956.xml	S60	Data and methods	NEG	Values of P < 0.05 were considered statistically significant.
TEST	NEG	PMC5120956.xml	S97	Discussion	NEG	The reason may be that the mean degree of scoliotic deformation is different between the patients of the 2 studies.
TEST	NEG	PMC5120957.xml	S13	Abstract	NEG	Image noise of the 100-kVp (53.6 ± 18.5 HU) and i-100-kVp (30.9 ± 8.6 HU) protocols were higher than that of the120-kVp protocol (23.8 ± 5.7 HU).
TEST	NEG	PMC5120957.xml	S33	Introduction	NEG	The purpose of this study was to compare the radiation dose and image quality of retrospective ECG-gated cardiac CT between combined 100-kVp protocol with HIR and display preset optimization and the 120-kVp protocol with FBP.
TEST	NEG	PMC5120957.xml	S56	Materials and methods	NEG	In all patients, iopamidol 370 mg/mL (Nihon Schering, Osaka, Japan) was delivered over a fixed period of 15 seconds via a 20-gauge catheter inserted into an antecubital vein using a power injector (DUAL SHOT GX; Nemoto-Kyorindo, Tokyo, Japan).
TEST	NEG	PMC5120957.xml	S128	Results	NEG	437.3 ± 55.7 HU [P < 0.01]; i-100-kVp vs.
TEST	NEG	PMC5121105.xml	S6		NEG	Main outcome measure Incidence of coronary heart disease (n=7035) was self-reported, and related deaths were identified by searching National Death Index or through report of next of kin or postal authority.
TEST	NEG	PMC5121105.xml	S20		NEG	But in practice, calories from SFA have mainly been replaced with low quality carbohydrate,7 which exert clear adverse effects on cardiometabolic disorders such as obesity and diabetes.8
TEST	NEG	PMC5121105.xml	S27		NEG	In the current study, we updated the analyses on associations between intake of individual SFAs and risk of coronary heart disease in the Nurses’ Health Study with an extended follow-up of 18 years.
TEST	NEG	PMC5121105.xml	S34		NEG	Return of self-administered questionnaires was considered informed consent.
TEST	NEG	PMC5121105.xml	S35		NEG	The current analysis was conducted among 81 757 women and 51 529 men who completed a food frequency questionnaire at study baseline (years 1984 for the Nurses’ Health Study and 1986 for the Health Professionals Follow-up Study).
TEST	NEG	PMC5121105.xml	S45		NEG	The study baseline year was 1984 for the Nurses’ Health Study, for more comprehensive estimates of individual SFA intake starting from this follow-up cycle.
TEST	NEG	PMC5121105.xml	S47		NEG	Participants were asked how often, on average, they had consumed specific foods in the past year, with nine responses ranging from “never” to “at least six times per day” based on a specified standard portion size.
TEST	NEG	PMC5121105.xml	S71		NEG	Fatal coronary heart disease was confirmed by a review of hospital records or autopsy reports if coronary heart disease was listed as the underlying cause of death and if evidence of previous coronary heart disease was available from medical records.
TEST	NEG	PMC5121105.xml	S89		NEG	In this analysis, we first calculated the difference in mean SFA intake between the highest and lowest groups, and then derived the relative risk reduction of coronary heart disease corresponding to this change using hazard ratios in the substitution model above (estimated effects of 1% energy substitution).
TEST	NEG	PMC5121105.xml	S121		NEG	For each 1% energy substitution for 16:0, the estimated absolute risk reductions were 34.4 cases per 100 000 person years for polyunsaturated fat, 28.7 cases per 100 000 person years for whole grain carbohydrates, and 31.5 cases per 100 000 person years for plant proteins.
TEST	NEG	PMC5121105.xml	S125		NEG	When mean 12:0-18:0 intake decreased from the highest intake group to the lowest, absolute risk reduction was estimated to be 106.2 cases of coronary heart disease per 100 000 person years when replaced by polyunsaturated fat, 70.9 cases per 100 000 person years by monounsaturated fat, 83.2 cases per 100 000 person years by whole grain carbohydrates, and 94.9 cases per 100 000 person years by plant proteins.
TEST	NEG	PMC5121105.xml	S128		NEG	Substitution analysis was stratified by age, body mass index, physical activity, and smoking status (supplementary table 2), and all P values for interaction were greater than 0.05.
TEST	NEG	PMC5121105.xml	S133		NEG	In two large prospective cohorts of US men and women, dietary intakes of major individual SFAs—including lauric acid (12:0), myristic acid (14:0), palmitic acid (16:0), and stearic acid (18:0)—were positively associated with risk of coronary heart disease during 24-28 years of follow-up.
TEST	NEG	PMC5121105.xml	S134		NEG	Replacement of 1% daily energy intake from the combined group of 12:0-18:0 by equivalent energy from polyunsaturated fat, whole grain carbohydrates, or plant proteins was associated with a 6-8% reduced risk of coronary heart disease.
TEST	POS	PMC5121105.xml	S145		NEG	In a meta-analysis of prospective studies, de Souza and colleagues did not find significant associations between total saturated fat intake and coronary heart disease, but noticed large heterogeneity among estimates from different studies.3
TEST	POS	PMC5121105.xml	S146		NEG	The most plausible reason for such heterogeneity is the inconsistent adjustment of covariates (especially macronutrients) in the individual studies.3
TEST	POS	PMC5121105.xml	S147		NEG	As a result, the associations could reflect the effects of substituting SFA for various other macronutrients (depending on the statistical modeling in individual studies), with mixed health effects.
TEST	POS	PMC5121105.xml	S148		NEG	Most importantly, without a specified replacement, the comparison is largely with refined starch and sugar because these are the dominant sources of calories in the US diet.
TEST	POS	PMC5121105.xml	S149		NEG	Our previous analysis in the Nurses’ Health Study and the Health Professionals Follow-up Study found a consistently lower risk of coronary heart disease when total saturated fat was replaced by polyunsaturated fat, monounsaturated fat, or whole grain carbohydrates, whereas replacing SFAs with refined carbohydrate was not associated with a lower risk.7
TEST	POS	PMC5121105.xml	S150		NEG	A previous pooling analysis of 11 prospective cohort studies that specified the substituting macronutrient also observed that incidence of coronary heart disease and mortality was 26% and 13% lower, respectively, when 5% energy from saturated fat was replaced by polyunsaturated fat.5
TEST	POS	PMC5121105.xml	S151		NEG	Such findings are in line with a meta-analysis of eight large clinical trials reporting that replacement of 5% energy as saturated fat with polyunsaturated fat led to a 19% reduction in coronary heart disease risk during a median follow-up duration of 4.5 years.6
TEST	NEG	PMC5121105.xml	S163		NEG	Palm oil, the most commonly produced edible oil in the world, contains over 40% fat as 16:0, whereas coconut oil and palm kernel oil are high in 12:0 (over 45% fat).33
TEST	POS	PMC5121105.xml	S171		NEG	Several limitations should be discussed as well.
TEST	POS	PMC5121105.xml	S172		POS	Firstly, although we adjusted for a multitude of covariates, including demographic characteristics, lifestyle, medical history, and dietary factors, potential unmeasured and residual confounding cannot be excluded.
TEST	POS	PMC5121105.xml	S173		POS	Secondly, our study populations exclusively consisted of health professionals with a relatively homogeneous ethnic background and socioeconomic status.
TEST	POS	PMC5121105.xml	S174		POS	Although this renders the study results less susceptible to confounding by ethnicity and socioeconomic factors, such homogeneity could limit the generalizability of findings to other ethnic groups or populations with different socioeconomic profiles.
TEST	POS	PMC5121105.xml	S175		POS	Thirdly, dietary data derived from food frequency questionnaires are measured, inevitably, with errors.
TEST	POS	PMC5121105.xml	S176		POS	Because of the prospective design, these errors are most likely to bias true associations towards the null.
TEST	POS	PMC5121105.xml	S177		POS	Lastly, it is difficult to disentangle associations of individual SFAs that are highly correlated with each other in this observational study setting.
TEST	POS	PMC5121105.xml	S178		POS	Potential differential effects of individual SFAs on cardiovascular risk warrant further investigation in other cohort studies.
TEST	NEG	PMC5121130.xml	S24	Summary	NEG	The reactions of the patients to the general practitioners' brief interventions did not differ significantly between the study groups in terms of appropriateness (adjusted odds ratio 0·89, 95% CI 0·75–1·07, p=0·21) or helpfulness (1·05, 0·89–1·26, p=0·54); overall, four (<1%) patients thought their intervention was inappropriate and unhelpful and 1530 (81%) patients thought it was appropriate and helpful.
TEST	NEG	PMC5121130.xml	S83	Methods	NEG	The design of the intervention was informed by evidence that an offer of help to change is more motivating than advice to do so.18
TEST	NEG	PMC5121130.xml	S114	Methods	NEG	Our sample size was based on the assumption that people lost to follow-up would be imputed as not having changed weight: ie, baseline observation carried forward (BOCF).24
TEST	NEG	PMC5121130.xml	S182	Discussion	NEG	On average, individuals in who only received this advice lost more than 1 kg, which is typical of a population motivated to lose weight.29
TEST	NEG	PMC5121131.xml	S5	Summary	NEG	We aimed to follow-up the Preschool Autism Communication Trial (PACT), to investigate whether the PACT intervention had a long-term effect on autism symptoms and continued effects on parent and child social interaction.
TEST	NEG	PMC5121131.xml	S72	Method	NEG	Assessment of primary outcomes was done by assessors unaware of treatment allocation.
TEST	NEG	PMC5121131.xml	S135	Results	NEG	The 31 participants lost to follow-up (six during the trial and 25 during follow-up) had no significant associations with treatment group, centre, autism severity, level of adaptive functioning, or any of the demographic measures shown in table 1.
TEST	NEG	PMC5121131.xml	S162	Discussion	NEG	A similar treatment effect is also seen in parent-reported symptom measures at follow-up which, although unblinded, have the potential complementary strengths of being service-user outcome measures and being based on knowledge of the child in naturalistic settings.
TEST	NEG	PMC5121182.xml	S14	Background	NEG	Duration of treatment tended to be shorter as the Child-Pugh score worsened.
TEST	NEG	PMC5121182.xml	S28	Introduction	NEG	Progress made in the understanding of the molecular mechanisms involved in the development and proliferation of tumors has enabled the development of effective therapeutic agents (i.e., targeted molecular therapy) for progressive HCC [10, 11].
TEST	NEG	PMC5121182.xml	S131	Discussion	NEG	In the SHARP trial, times to deterioration of liver function (Child-Pugh classification) were similar between the sorafenib and placebo arm (data not shown).
TEST	NEG	PMC5121182.xml	S151	Discussion	POS	Thus, obtaining background information and treatment trends from real-world practice data in Japanese patients may provide a valuable contribution to the future of HCC treatment.
TEST	NEG	PMC5122018.xml	S72	Results	NEG	The most frequently reported AEs for the FF treatment groups in the integrated analysis were headache, nasopharyngitis, upper respiratory tract infection, bronchitis, oropharyngeal pain and cough (Table 3).
TEST	NEG	PMC5122018.xml	S103	Efficacy in Phase II/III studies	NEG	Finally, in a Phase II study, patients with persistent asthma not controlled by short-acting beta2 agonists had significant FEV1 and evening PEF improvements after receiving FF 100 μg or 200 μg, versus placebo (p ≤0.005 [18]).
TEST	NEG	PMC5122018.xml	S106	Efficacy in Phase II/III studies	NEG	In the only two Phase III studies that compared FF with placebo, FF 100 μg demonstrated significant improvements in the proportion of rescue-free 24-h periods versus placebo (14.8%, p <0.001 [23], and 8.7%, p = 0.007 [21]).
TEST	NEG	PMC5122018.xml	S131	Discussion	NEG	Consistent with previous results [37], the data presented here suggest that FF has a wide therapeutic index; the therapeutic dose range was efficacious across individual studies, with a tolerability profile as expected for the class and no evidence of cortisol suppression at the doses assessed.
TEST	NEG	PMC5122318.xml	S11		NEG	It is important to consider diet and lifestyle factors in the evaluation of the association between BMI and mortality.
TEST	NEG	PMC5122318.xml	S15		NEG	Normal weight, defined as a body mass index (BMI) between 18.5-24.9, is a broad reference group containing not only non-smokers who are lean because they are physically active and eating healthy diets but also those who are within the normal BMI range for other reasons that accelerate the ageing process (such as chronic inflammation, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, and neurodegenerative diseases), probably leading to an artificially reduced mortality among the overweight and moderately obese groups.6 7 8 9 10
TEST	NEG	PMC5122318.xml	S46		NEG	The correlation between moderate to vigorous activity reported in diaries and that reported on the questionnaires was 0.62.19
TEST	POS	PMC5122318.xml	S137		NEG	There are, however, some potential limitations.
TEST	POS	PMC5122318.xml	S138		POS	Our cohorts included only health professionals, mostly white men and women, which might limit the generalizability of the findings.
TEST	POS	PMC5122318.xml	S139		NEG	The relative homogeneity of the study population in educational attainment and socioeconomic status, however, enhances the internal validity.
TEST	POS	PMC5122318.xml	S140		POS	Also, though measurement errors in self reported lifestyle factors are inevitable, because of the prospective design these errors are typically unrelated to the outcomes of the study and are thus likely to have attenuated the observed associations.
TEST	NEG	PMC5122318.xml	S150		NEG	The U shaped relation between BMI and mortality observed in many epidemiological studies is driven by an over-representation of individuals who are lean because of chronic metabolic and pathological conditions caused by exposure to smoking, a sedentary lifestyle, and/or unhealthy diets, making them more susceptible to death
TEST	NEG	PMC5124241.xml	S6	Background	NEG	We investigated the impact of variable ventilation on lung function and histologic damage, as well as markers of lung inflammation, epithelial and endothelial cell damage, and alveolar stress, and bacterial translocation in experimental pneumonia.

TEST	NEG	PMC5124241.xml	S45	Background	NEG	We hypothesized that variable ventilation would improve pulmonary function and reduce lung damage without increasing bacterial translocation.
TEST	NEG	PMC5124241.xml	S54	Methods	NEG	A second catheter (PE-50, Becton, Dickinson and Company) was then placed in the right internal carotid artery for blood sampling and gas analysis (Radiometer ABL80 FLEX, Copenhagen NV, Denmark), as well as monitoring of mean arterial pressure (MAP) (Networked Multiparameter Veterinary Monitor LifeWindow 6000 V; Digicare Animal Health, Boynton Beach, FL, USA).
TEST	NEG	PMC5124241.xml	S65	Methods	NEG	Variable ventilation was applied as described in detail elsewhere [15, 16] Briefly, a sequence of randomly generated VT values (normal distribution, mean = 6 mL/kg, coefficient of variation [CV] = 30%, n = 600) was applied in volume-controlled mode using a routine developed by our group (nVentInspira, Dresden, Germany).
TEST	NEG	PMC5124241.xml	S73	Methods	NEG	The mechanical properties of the lungs, namely elastance (EL) and resistance (RL), were calculated by fitting the signals to the equation of motion, according to transpulmonary pressure (PL = Paw−Pes), as shown in Equation 1:where P0,L is PL at end expiration.
TEST	NEG	PMC5124241.xml	S79	Methods	NEG	Each feature was scored according to severity, with 0 denoting no effect and 4 denoting maximum severity, and extent, with 0 denoting no appearance and 4 denoting full involvement.

TEST	POS	PMC5124241.xml	S162	Discussion	NEG	Nevertheless, in a 10-year retrospective study [21], 45.8% of patients had nosocomial-acquired pneumonia caused by Pseudomonas aeruginosa.
TEST	POS	PMC5124241.xml	S163	Discussion	NEG	Furthermore, lungs infected by other pathogens might also benefit from VV-induced responses, e.g., increased production of surfactant.
TEST	POS	PMC5124241.xml	S164	Discussion	POS	Second, the data presented herein refer to the application of variable ventilation during controlled mechanical ventilation, not assisted ventilation, which might have yielded different results.
TEST	POS	PMC5124241.xml	S165	Discussion	POS	Third, unlike in clinical settings, PEEP, respiratory rate, and FiO2 were kept constant.
TEST	POS	PMC5124241.xml	S166	Discussion	NEG	However, as the main objective was to evaluate VV, confounding factors resulting from changes in ventilator settings were excluded.
TEST	POS	PMC5124241.xml	S167	Discussion	POS	In this line, the level of PEEP used in the current study, while often used in rats, may not be directly extrapolated to the clinical setting.
TEST	POS	PMC5124241.xml	S168	Discussion	NEG	Nevertheless, it has been estimated that values of PEEP in rats should be multiplied by a factor of 2 to 2.5 [44], when comparing with humans.
TEST	POS	PMC5124241.xml	S169	Discussion	NEG	In our study, this corresponds to 10 to 12.5 cmH2O, i.e., a moderate to high PEEP value in humans.
TEST	POS	PMC5124241.xml	S170	Discussion	POS	Fourth, the observation time was relatively short (2 h of mechanical ventilation), precluding extrapolation of the findings to longer periods of ventilation.
TEST	POS	PMC5124241.xml	S171	Discussion	POS	Finally, protein levels of biomarkers of VILI were not determined.
TEST	POS	PMC5124241.xml	S172	Discussion	POS	Instead, we chose to assess expression of biomarker mRNA, because an experimental period of 2 h might not be sufficient to detect differences in protein levels [45–48].
TEST	NEG	PMC5124273.xml	S9	Background	NEG	Primary airway BCs were isolated by bronchoscopy from healthy individuals and COPD patients and subsequently transfected with pcDNA3.1-TROP2 or siRNA sequence in vitro.
TEST	NEG	PMC5124273.xml	S51	Methods	NEG	The inclusion criterium for smokers with and without COPD was a smoking index of > 10 pack-years which was calculated by multiplying the number of cigarette packs consumed per day (20 cigarettes per pack) with the number of years of smoking.
TEST	NEG	PMC5124273.xml	S153	Results	NEG	Two assays were performed to assess the possible function of TROP2 in promoting the proliferation of BCs: the CCK-8 assay to measure cell viability which is directly proportional to increases in cell number, and flow cytometry to assess cell cycle progression.
TEST	NEG	PMC5124273.xml	S207	Discussion	NEG	The mechanism of TROP2-induced activation of pERK1/2 in BCs is unclear.

TEST	NEG	PMC5126992.xml	S4		NEG	Whereas the use of soluble factors as agents to modulate the fate of stem cells was established from an early stage of the research with this type of cells, it took longer to recognize that the physical microenvironment locally sensed by stem cells (e.g.
TEST	NEG	PMC5126992.xml	S69		NEG	For instance, soft matrices that mimic brain stiffness are neurogenic, while stiffer matrices mimicking muscle are myogenic and more rigid matrices that mimic bone are osteogenic [31].
TEST	NEG	PMC5126992.xml	S121		NEG	These studies started with mouse and rat models and employed bioreactors based on methodologies such as diffusion [12], dynamic rotating wall vessel [86], airways ventilation [11] or both airway ventilation and vascular perfusion [13, 14].

TEST	NEG	PMC5129502.xml	S14	Objective	NEG	The establishment of critical differences in PROs distinguishes true responses from random variation and provides insights into appropriate patient management.
TEST	NEG	PMC5129502.xml	S22	INTRODUCTION	NEG	We used statistical methods to determine a critical difference (dcrit) required for significant individual patient responses in patient‐reported outcomes (PROs) in patients initiating therapy with adalimumab, a tumor necrosis factor inhibitor, and to evaluate correlations between PROs (pain, fatigue, and function) and objective measures of disease activity, such as the Disease Activity Score in 28 joints (DAS28).Of the 3 PROs evaluated, pain showed the highest correlation with DAS28 and fatigue showed the lowest.
TEST	NEG	PMC5129502.xml	S94	RESULTS	NEG	An alternative way of looking at PRO reporting patterns in patients with a therapeutic response at month 12 is presented in Figure 2.
TEST	NEG	PMC5129502.xml	S155	DISCUSSION	NEG	In contrast, of the patients who did not achieve a DAS28‐dcrit response at month 12, 59% had no significant PRO responses, and significant improvements in all 3 PROs occurred in only 4%.
TEST	NEG	PMC5129580.xml	S168		NEG	These data support the widely held suspicion that confined placental mosaicism is one source of positive plasma‐based NIPT results followed by normal amniocentesis or CVS.
TEST	NEG	PMC5129580.xml	S181		NEG	Therefore, persistent cells from a previous pregnancy are extremely unlikely to be recovered by this method.
TEST	NEG	PMC5129580.xml	S220		NEG	We further believe that all of the enrichment, staining, picking, genotyping, amplification, and NGS steps can be automated.
TEST	NEG	PMC5129580.xml	S246		NEG	The fully assembled device now contains a step‐gradient of density fluids.
TEST	NEG	PMC5130923.xml	S54		NEG	We used one way analysis of variance to compare the differences in continuous variables by year and a χ2test to compare the differences in categorical variables by year.
TEST	NEG	PMC5130923.xml	S74		NEG	The incidence of clinically detected tumours less than 10 mm also showed a modest increase, from 0.49 per 100 000 population in 1999 to 4.88 per 100 000 population in 2008 (absolute difference 4.39).
TEST	NEG	PMC5130923.xml	S81		NEG	Overall, between 1999 and 2008 there was a 6.7-fold (95% confidence interval 5.8-fold to 7.8-fold) increase in localised stage tumours and an 8.1-fold (7.2-fold to 9.2-fold) increase in regional stage tumours.
TEST	NEG	PMC5130923.xml	S90		NEG	The regional SEER summary stage includes tumours with regional lymph node involvement and those with extrathyroidal extension.
TEST	POS	PMC5130923.xml	S122		NEG	However, this study has some limitations.
TEST	POS	PMC5130923.xml	S123		POS	Our data might have a misclassification bias for methods of tumour detection, which could cause either underestimation or overestimation of the incidence rate in specific subgroups.
TEST	POS	PMC5130923.xml	S124		NEG	However, in our study, we used sample weights to calculate an unbiased estimate after adjusting for the non-response units.
TEST	POS	PMC5130923.xml	S125		NEG	Indeed, the estimated incidence from NEST data was similar to the real incidence from cancer registry data (see supplementary tables 1 and 2).
TEST	POS	PMC5130923.xml	S126		POS	In addition, the estimated proportion of clinically detected cases from our findings in 2008 was similar to those from the Korea National Cancer Screening Survey study in 2009.27 Nevertheless, because of the relatively short follow-up, we could not secure the long term survival outcome data, which is the inherent limitation of this study of thyroid cancer.
TEST	NEG	PMC5130923.xml	S134		NEG	To date, the only confirmed risk factor for thyroid cancer is exposure to ionising radiation.34
TEST	NEG	PMC5130924.xml	S7		NEG	Current treatment was subdivided into duration of more or less than six months.
TEST	NEG	PMC5130924.xml	S11		NEG	The rate ratio after more than six months’ treatment was 1.00 (0.68 to 1.47), and after treatment cessation it was 0.68 (0.43 to 1.07).
TEST	NEG	PMC5130924.xml	S33		NEG	The CPRD is broadly representative of the UK population in terms of age, sex, and ethnicity.
TEST	NEG	PMC5130924.xml	S65		NEG	For all cases and their matched controls, we estimated exposure from all prescriptions for a testosterone product issued before the index date.
TEST	NEG	PMC5130924.xml	S74		NEG	The grace period was to account for residual effects of testosterone or imperfect adherence to the prescribed testosterone regimen (for example, late make-up for missed doses and/or remaining drug after apparent date of cessation).
TEST	NEG	PMC5130924.xml	S75		NEG	The coverage days for all testosterone products were based on expert opinion, and the median time between product specific prescriptions was 14 or 84 days for shorter and longer acting testosterone injections, 150 days for implants, and 30 days for products with another (oral, transdermal) route of administration.
TEST	NEG	PMC5130924.xml	S81		NEG	Other covariates were body mass index (using cut-offs of 18.5, 25.0, 30.0, and 35.0), smoking and drinking status based on the last information before or on the index date, socioeconomic status, and prescriptions for the following drugs within 90 days of the index date: megestrol, non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs, systemic corticosteroids, and antiplatelets.
TEST	NEG	PMC5130924.xml	S83		NEG	We used conditional logistic regression to calculate crude and adjusted odds ratios that are estimates of the incidence rate ratios.
TEST	NEG	PMC5130924.xml	S96		NEG	The source population consisted of 2.92 million men.
TEST	NEG	PMC5130924.xml	S101		NEG	Cases were more often obese (body mass index ≥30: 27.0% v 20.6%) and had more comorbidities, notably polycythaemia, chronic pulmonary disease, congestive heart failure, myocardial infarction, and peripheral vascular disease than did the controls.
TEST	NEG	PMC5130924.xml	S104		NEG	Of the 19 215 cases, 69 venous thromboembolisms (0.36%; 28 deep vein thromboses and 41 pulmonary embolisms) occurred during current testosterone treatment and 22 (0.11%; 7 deep vein thromboses and 15 pulmonary embolisms) after recent treatment (table 2).
TEST	NEG	PMC5130924.xml	S109		NEG	The rate ratio of venous thromboembolism associated with starting a new course of testosterone treatment within six months was 1.63 (1.12 to 2.37), corresponding to an excess incidence rate of 10.0 (1.9 to 21.6) additional venous thromboembolisms per 10 000 person years, whereas the rate ratio for treatment started longer than six months before the index date was 1.00 (0.68 to 1.47).
TEST	NEG	PMC5130924.xml	S113		NEG	In contrast, the rate ratio among patients with pathological hypogonadism was not significant for current testosterone treatment 1.08 (0.75 to 1.55), and it was 1.52 (0.94 to 2.46) for treatment started less than six months before (table 2).
TEST	NEG	PMC5130924.xml	S115		NEG	Among patients with at least one known risk factor for venous thromboembolism, the rate ratio was 0.99 (0.65 to 1.49) for current testosterone users and 1.41 (0.82 to 2.41) for those who had started a new course of testosterone treatment within the previous six months.
TEST	NEG	PMC5130924.xml	S130		NEG	The first is depletion of susceptible patients,26 with a different proportion of very long term testosterone users among those with and those without pathological hypogonadism (testosterone treatment is lifelong for pathological hypogonadism,2 whereas for men without pathological hypogonadism it is characteristically short term27).
TEST	POS	PMC5130924.xml	S132		POS	The limitations of this study include those seen in all observational studies: unmeasured or residual confounding or hidden bias that might exist undetected.
TEST	POS	PMC5130924.xml	S133		POS	To minimise residual confounding, we also matched cases to controls on history of individual known risk factors for venous thromboembolism including a medical illness, surgery and trauma, and active cancer within 90 days of the index day.
TEST	POS	PMC5130924.xml	S134		NEG	Stratification by presence and absence of known risk factors for venous thromboembolism showed non-significant differences between patients with and without the known risk factor.
TEST	POS	PMC5130924.xml	S135		NEG	Although the rate ratios were not statistically different, the difference in magnitudes of effect may be clinically relevant (1.91 v 1.41).
TEST	POS	PMC5130924.xml	S136		NEG	Case-control studies are prone to time window bias if the cases and controls are not defined by the same risk sets and the time windows for measuring exposure in cases and controls are not equal.
TEST	POS	PMC5130924.xml	S137		NEG	In this study, we avoided time window bias by handling cases and controls in exactly the same way.
TEST	POS	PMC5130924.xml	S138		POS	To mitigate the effect of polycythaemia as a potential mediator as well as of prostate cancer, a contraindication for testosterone use that could have altered the testosterone exposure status, we did sensitivity analysis without additional adjustment for polycythaemia and excluding all cases and controls with a history of prostate cancer.
TEST	POS	PMC5130924.xml	S139		NEG	The study results remained basically unchanged.
TEST	POS	PMC5130924.xml	S140		POS	Nevertheless, unmeasured confounding remains a limitation.
TEST	POS	PMC5130924.xml	S141		POS	Another limitation is the potential for misclassification of exposure due to residual effects of the drug, remaining drug, and/or lack of adherence to treatment after apparent cessation.
TEST	POS	PMC5130924.xml	S142		NEG	For this reason, we included a 30 day grace period in the original analysis, and a further sensitivity analysis using a shorter (15 day) and extended (60 day) grace period did not alter the findings.
TEST	POS	PMC5130924.xml	S143		POS	The sensitivity of the algorithm for detecting venous thromboembolism was 92.6%, which implies that we may have failed to identify around 7.4% of cases.
TEST	POS	PMC5130924.xml	S144		NEG	This would be a problem only if differential identification occurred (identification of venous thromboembolism cases being more likely if they were treated with testosterone).
TEST	POS	PMC5130924.xml	S145		NEG	However, this is unlikely to be the case and is unlikely to have altered the study findings.
TEST	POS	PMC5130924.xml	S146		POS	Finally, despite the large number of more than 19 000 venous thromboembolisms in the study population, only 69 cases were currently treated with testosterone, so subgroup analyses were based on even smaller numbers with decreased analytical power.
TEST	NEG	PMC5130942.xml	S12	Background	NEG	A total of 2541 respondents, representing 65.6 % of the original mailing list of 3872 US addresses.
TEST	NEG	PMC5130942.xml	S16	Background	NEG	Overall percentage of respondents reporting rationing behavior in various contexts and assessment of attitudes toward rationing.
TEST	NEG	PMC5130942.xml	S23	Background	NEG	A more positive opinion about rationing tended to align with greater odds of rationing.
TEST	NEG	PMC5130942.xml	S57	METHODS	NEG	All analyses were performed using SAS version 9.
TEST	NEG	PMC5130942.xml	S94	RESULTS	NEG	The overall chi-square test comparing response distributions among the three framing versions was statistically significant (X 2 = 1025.5; p < 0.0001), as were all between-group differences (Group 1 vs.
TEST	NEG	PMC5130942.xml	S105	DISCUSSION	NEG	Physicians in medical school settings were least likely to report rationing.
TEST	NEG	PMC5130942.xml	S121	DISCUSSION	NEG	Solo practitioners who reported greater rationing behavior may have fewer resources to deal with the paperwork and other barriers; it may be easier not to make the effort in the first place when they know that their efforts will likely be in vain or will not be compensated.
TEST	NEG	PMC5130942.xml	S122	DISCUSSION	NEG	This response, in turn, could relate to feelings of powerlessness associated with our earlier-reported findings that, overall, physicians rated patients, health systems, and malpractice attorneys as more responsible for addressing healthcare costs than they were.1
TEST	NEG	PMC5130942.xml	S140	DISCUSSION	NEG	Findings like these may prompt more honest and sensible professional discourse on this important but controversial topic.
TEST	NEG	PMC5130942.xml	S141	DISCUSSION	NEG	Although we avoided the term “rationing” in the survey, the stigma surrounding the word in the United States may have led to underreporting of actual behavior by study participants.
TEST	POS	PMC5130942.xml	S142	DISCUSSION	NEG	This study has several limitations.
TEST	POS	PMC5130942.xml	S143	DISCUSSION	POS	Estimates of specialty differences in rationing behavior should be treated with caution, because the AMA Physician Masterfile database relies on self-reported specialty data.
TEST	POS	PMC5130942.xml	S144	DISCUSSION	POS	Moreover, studying self-reported behavior does not directly address the motivations and intentions behind the behavioral choices described herein.
TEST	POS	PMC5130942.xml	S145	DISCUSSION	POS	Similarities or differences between these data and those recorded in Europe several years ago, including potential sampling differences, make it difficult to draw direct and specific comparisons.
TEST	POS	PMC5130942.xml	S146	DISCUSSION	POS	Greater granularity of information regarding the specific practice and patient population characteristics of our respondents would help to further explain the behavior.
TEST	POS	PMC5130942.xml	S147	DISCUSSION	POS	Unfortunately, such data were not available.
TEST	POS	PMC5130942.xml	S148	DISCUSSION	POS	We also acknowledge that non-response bias could be a factor in our study.10 , 11
TEST	POS	PMC5130942.xml	S149	DISCUSSION	NEG	The main contribution of this study is that it goes beyond physician-reported attitudes, to physician self-reported behavior that rationing does occur.
TEST	POS	PMC5130942.xml	S150	DISCUSSION	NEG	However, with respect to self-reported rationing behavior, even if all of the non-responding physicians had reported “never” rationing, that would still mean that about 35 % of US physicians (1348/3872) reported rationing behavior.
TEST	POS	PMC5130942.xml	S151	DISCUSSION	NEG	Future research could examine the disconnect between physician opinion and behavior when it comes to rationing.

TEST	NEG	PMC5132036.xml	S7	Objective	NEG	In these post hoc analyses, outcomes were compared between the ustekinumab and placebo groups for 3 mutually exclusive antecedent‐exposure populations from the combined studies: MTX/anti‐TNF naive (placebo, n = 56; 45 mg, n = 58; and 90 mg, n = 66), MTX experienced, biologic agent naive (placebo, n = 192; 45 mg, n = 190; and 90 mg, n = 185), and anti‐TNF experienced with or without MTX (placebo, n = 62; 45 mg, n = 60; and 90 mg, n = 58).
TEST	NEG	PMC5132036.xml	S13	Objective	NEG	Significant improvements in PROs with ustekinumab versus placebo were observed in 3 antecedent‐exposure populations of PsA patients, including those with prior MTX and anti‐TNF use.

TEST	NEG	PMC5132134.xml	S6	Objective	NEG	Patients were categorized by duration of time between their last rituximab infusion and initiation of a subsequent biologic agent (≤5 months, 6–11 months, and ≥12 months).
TEST	NEG	PMC5132134.xml	S57	Patients and methods	NEG	Potential confounders (measured at baseline and defined as characteristics that differed by time to initiation and were associated with infection in the unadjusted models) were included in the model, and the adjusted hazard ratio (HR) for time to initiation was estimated.
TEST	NEG	PMC5132134.xml	S82	Results	NEG	The time to the first infectious event after starting the subsequent biologic agent was similar between patient groups (Figure 1A).
TEST	NEG	PMC5132134.xml	S144	Supporting information	NEG	Baseline visit was at the time of subsequent (non‐rituximab) biologic initiation.
TEST	NEG	PMC5134764.xml	S87		NEG	Splenectomy was performed after a median time of 16 months (range 2–140) after ITP diagnosis, by laparotomy in 50 cases (62.5%) or laparoscopy in 30 (37.5%) (3 missing data).
TEST	NEG	PMC5134764.xml	S126		NEG	Patients with and without response did not differ in incidence of infections (Table 3; Supplemental Fig. 1C).
TEST	NEG	PMC5134764.xml	S146		NEG	However, on long-term follow-up, the frequency of complications did not differ between these 2 groups; the effect of the surgery was probably less important at that time.
TEST	NEG	PMC5134764.xml	S195		POS	Moreover, because more than 70% of controls had a chronic ITP (i.e., ITP duration longer than 1 year), the duration of ITP may have influenced the results.
TEST	NEG	PMC5134765.xml	S60	Materials	NEG	The names and doses of the drugs that were administered before, during and after surgery were recorded in detail, and symptomatic treatments were performed for the specific events that appeared during the operation period.
TEST	NEG	PMC5134765.xml	S77	Materials	NEG	The 2 ends of this scale were labeled as the “0” end and the “10” end, respectively.
TEST	NEG	PMC5134765.xml	S118	Discussion	NEG	Therefore, on the basis of not reducing the analgesic effect, the prophylactic use of antiemetic drugs or drugs that can reduce the adverse reactions of opioids can improve the postoperative satisfaction rate of analgesia in patients.
TEST	NEG	PMC5134765.xml	S131	Discussion	NEG	In addition, the difference in the VAS scores of patients between the tropisetron and fentanyl groups was not statistically significant, which was also consistent with the study results of Derbent.[20]

TEST	NEG	PMC5134766.xml	S138	Results	NEG	In the CG, no significant difference was found in the improvement between first and second month (P > 0.05).
TEST	NEG	PMC5134766.xml	S183	Discussion	NEG	A number of animal studies demonstrated that acupuncture can affect a variety of factors potentially related with ICH, such as reducing the expression of cytochrome C and p53 protein to decrease neuronal apoptosis, upregulating the expression of brain-derived neurotrophic factor and nerve growth factor to improve nerve regeneration, downregulating neuron-specific enolase expression to keep neuronal cell membrane integrity.[31]
TEST	NEG	PMC5134767.xml	S63	Methods	NEG	A P value <0.05 was considered to be statistically significant.
TEST	NEG	PMC5134767.xml	S93	Discussion	NEG	To our knowledge, this large study is the first to examine this topic.
TEST	NEG	PMC5134767.xml	S116	Discussion	NEG	Meen and Chandra[32] reported no improvement in AHI after nasal surgery, but consistent improvement in subjective symptoms of OSA such as sleepiness and overall quality of life.
TEST	NEG	PMC5134767.xml	S129	Discussion	POS	The lack of prospective data collection could have introduced bias into the data because patients were excluded for lack of sufficient data (the main reason of the lack of control group) or missing part of the original 24-hour BP monitoring recordings only accurate hypertension grade were retained.

TEST	POS	PMC5134769.xml	S116		NEG	This study has a number of strengths and limitations.
TEST	POS	PMC5134769.xml	S117		NEG	Strengths include the fact that all evaluations were done in the same laboratory, on the same patient specimens by the same 2 operators whom had several years of experience with VL testing.
TEST	POS	PMC5134769.xml	S118		POS	However, the operators were not blind to the results of the reference test.
TEST	POS	PMC5134769.xml	S119		POS	As this evaluation used blood specimens collected from routine monitoring visits, limited volumes were available and all DBS results obtained with 3 different assays were compared to plasma results obtained from the Roche CAP/CTM v2.0 assay only.
TEST	POS	PMC5134769.xml	S120		NEG	Inherent differences between the different assays warrant caution when comparing data between assays.[20–24]
TEST	NEG	PMC5134770.xml	S28	Case report	NEG	On general physical examination, the patient showed signs of jaundice with upper abdomen tenderness but no guarding.

TEST	NEG	PMC5134774.xml	S39	Materials and methods	NEG	This is a retrospective and observational study of consecutive patients 18 years or older who visited our hospital for MBO over a 31-month period (2012–2014, since DNI analysis was implemented).
TEST	NEG	PMC5134774.xml	S53	Materials and methods	NEG	The study coordinators monitored the performance of the abstractors.
TEST	NEG	PMC5134774.xml	S74	Materials and methods	NEG	Normality was assessed using the Shapiro–Wilk test.
TEST	NEG	PMC5134774.xml	S78	Materials and methods	NEG	Additionally, the ability of each method to predict the presence of strangulated bowel obstruction was compared using the area under the curve (AUC).
TEST	NEG	PMC5134774.xml	S93	Results	NEG	The most common cause of strangulation was adhesion (66.9%), followed by carcinoma (16.3%), and bowel inflammation (9.4%).
TEST	NEG	PMC5134774.xml	S94	Results	NEG	One hundred twenty-two patients (77.7%) had small bowel obstruction (Tables 1 and 2).
TEST	NEG	PMC5134774.xml	S118	Discussion	NEG	Because it may be difficult to differentiate simple bowel obstruction from strangulated bowel obstruction with a single diagnostic method, we evaluated the predictive ability of abdominal CT combined with initial DNI.
TEST	NEG	PMC5134774.xml	S130	Discussion	NEG	Also, Simon et al reported that, for bacterial infections, serum CRP has little sensitivity and specificity.[28]
TEST	NEG	PMC5134774.xml	S134	Discussion	NEG	In this study, the SG had a shorter time between symptom onset and ED arrival than the NSG.
TEST	POS	PMC5134774.xml	S137	Discussion	NEG	This study has some limitations.
TEST	POS	PMC5134774.xml	S138	Discussion	POS	First, it has a retrospective design.
TEST	POS	PMC5134774.xml	S139	Discussion	POS	Many types of data are missing, especially those regarding initial symptoms and data from physical examination (e.g., rebound tenderness), and laboratory tests (e.g., initial serum lactate or base excess).
TEST	POS	PMC5134774.xml	S140	Discussion	NEG	Several experimental studies have demonstrated that lactate level is a useful predictor of intestinal ischemia, and clinical reports have described this parameter as a significant biomedical marker for diagnosing strangulated small bowel obstruction.[29,30]
TEST	POS	PMC5134774.xml	S141	Discussion	POS	In this study, although initial serum lactate level was significantly higher in patients in the SG than in those in the NSG (2.46 vs 1.09, P = 0.001), initial serum lactate was only measured in 93 of 160 patients (58.1%).
TEST	POS	PMC5134774.xml	S142	Discussion	POS	Therefore, we do not present results for initial serum lactate level because it was difficult to compare DNI or MPXI with lactate level.
TEST	POS	PMC5134774.xml	S143	Discussion	POS	Second, since this study was conducted at the emergency center of a single hospital, the sample size was small.
TEST	POS	PMC5134774.xml	S144	Discussion	NEG	Nevertheless, we investigated all MBO patients who were admitted to this hospital since DNI and MPXI levels became measureable in order to reduce possible biases.
TEST	POS	PMC5134774.xml	S145	Discussion	NEG	Third, DNI and MPXI values can be affected by infection or inflammation out of cause of MBO as well as presence of strangulation.
TEST	POS	PMC5134774.xml	S146	Discussion	NEG	However, there were no differences in the median results for DNI or MPXI values between the NSG and SG when we analyzed inflammatory markers after controlling for inflammation (DNI: 0% vs 3.2%, P = 0.001 and MPXI: 1.1 vs 1.3, P = 0.252).
TEST	POS	PMC5134774.xml	S147	Discussion	POS	Fourth, because serial DNI and MPXI values were not investigated postoperatively, we did not evaluate their usefulness for evaluating treatment responses by assessing changes in inflammatory markers after definitive treatment.
TEST	POS	PMC5134774.xml	S148	Discussion	POS	Therefore, a prospective study of DNI is needed to expand our current ability to predict complications and serial results after surgery.
TEST	NEG	PMC5134775.xml	S59	Methods	NEG	The ileocolic vessels were identified and elevated, and the peritoneum was incised laterally to the ileocolic vessels and superior mesenteric vein.
TEST	NEG	PMC5134775.xml	S101	Results	NEG	Postoperative complications in LG were: wound infection (13.8%; N = 4), bowel obstruction (3.4%; N = 1), and postoperative bleeding (3.4%; N = 1).
TEST	NEG	PMC5134775.xml	S141	Discussion	NEG	Obviously, bowel function recovery would be faster in TLG because of short exposure time during operation and less surgical trauma.
TEST	NEG	PMC5134775.xml	S148	Discussion	NEG	Other than tattooing of the lesion with India ink prior to surgery,[27] we routinely place 3 titanium clips to serve as landmarks adjacent to the tumor during colonoscopy examination and biopsy for better tumor localization during surgery.
TEST	NEG	PMC5134776.xml	S73		NEG	The balloon at the end of the PEG tube was inflated with 5 mL of sterile water, and the PEG tube was pulled until appropriate approximation of the balloon to the gastric wall was achieved (Fig. 2, see Video, Supplemental Digital Content 1 which shows the PEG insertion).

TEST	NEG	PMC5134776.xml	S100		NEG	The PEG balloon was pulled up to compress the bleeding site, resulting in reduction of the oozing.
TEST	NEG	PMC5134776.xml	S131		NEG	The patient in this case was obese and had a large stomach.
TEST	NEG	PMC5134777.xml	S67		NEG	The sitting BP was measured twice at 1-minute intervals and once after the patient had remained seated for 5 minutes.
TEST	NEG	PMC5134777.xml	S70		NEG	Hypertension was defined as a systolic BP of 140 mmHg or more, diastolic BP or 90 mmHg or more, or use of an antihypertensive drug.

TEST	NEG	PMC5134777.xml	S99		NEG	After propensity score matching, 110 strokes (2.0% vs 4.6%) and 141 deaths (1.4% vs 3.8%) occurred in the matched intervention and control pairs (n = 1078).
TEST	NEG	PMC5134777.xml	S105		NEG	The effect of short-term treatment of hypertension on the incidence of stroke and total death were studied more than 5 years after the project.
TEST	NEG	PMC5134777.xml	S114		NEG	There was a 60% decrease in deaths from stroke and 50% decrease in overall death in the intervention group compared with the control group.
TEST	POS	PMC5134777.xml	S124		NEG	The present study has several limitations.
TEST	POS	PMC5134777.xml	S125		POS	First, there were significant differences in the baseline data between the groups.
TEST	POS	PMC5134777.xml	S126		POS	Although propensity scoring and sensitivity analyses were carried out, important confounders may have been missed.
TEST	POS	PMC5134777.xml	S127		POS	Second, the study is limited by the limitations of the health record system.
TEST	POS	PMC5134777.xml	S128		POS	It was not possible to adjust for all factors that affect the risk of stroke, such as lipid status, hypertension, or family history.
TEST	POS	PMC5134777.xml	S129		POS	Third, the doctors’ practices were not evaluated during and after the program, and it was not clear whether their practices were retained at the time of follow-up.
TEST	POS	PMC5134777.xml	S130		POS	The rate of lost to follow up was near 30%, this maybe have biased the result assessment, although it was reported that a loss to follow-up of 22% would not bias conclusions.[41]
TEST	POS	PMC5134777.xml	S131		POS	Finally, ascertainment bias may have affected the results.
TEST	POS	PMC5134777.xml	S132		POS	For example, some strokes may have been missed if they led immediately to death.
TEST	NEG	PMC5134778.xml	S8	Abstract	NEG	One hundred forty patients, ages 19 to 70 years (American Society of Anesthesiologists physical status I–II), undergoing tracheal intubation for elective surgery were randomly allocated to the nonstylet group (n = 70) or the stylet group (n = 70).
TEST	NEG	PMC5134778.xml	S37	Methods	NEG	Patients received no premedication prior to surgery.
TEST	NEG	PMC5134778.xml	S46	Methods	NEG	In the stylet group, a malleable intubating stylet (Covidien, Ireland) with a hockey-stick curvature was inserted in the endotracheal tube, after which the distal tip of tube was bent just above the cuff to a 60° angle.
TEST	NEG	PMC5134778.xml	S51	Methods	NEG	The anesthesiologists performing the intubation accessed laryngoscopic views according to the Cormack and Lehane grade.
TEST	NEG	PMC5134778.xml	S66	Results	NEG	There were no significant differences in patient characteristics and airway assessment findings between the groups (Table 1).
TEST	NEG	PMC5134778.xml	S83	Discussion	NEG	Stylet use can essentially compensate for the geometrical weaknesses of indirect VL and may play an important role during intubation using McGrath VL.[16]
TEST	POS	PMC5134778.xml	S97	Discussion	NEG	This study has some limitations.
TEST	POS	PMC5134778.xml	S98	Discussion	POS	Firstly, the experienced anesthesiologists were not blinded to the use or nonuse of stylets.
TEST	POS	PMC5134778.xml	S99	Discussion	POS	Hawthorne effects might have affected the performance during intubation and the results.[18]
TEST	POS	PMC5134778.xml	S100	Discussion	POS	Secondly, because this study was performed by experienced anesthesiologists using the McGrath VL, our results might not completely extrapolate to the novice.
TEST	POS	PMC5134778.xml	S101	Discussion	POS	Thirdly, since we used only the McGrath VL, other indirect VLs, which have different features associated with a blade, might have different results concerning stylet use.
TEST	POS	PMC5134778.xml	S102	Discussion	POS	Further study might be needed to elucidate the effect of stylet use according to different VLs.
TEST	NEG	PMC5134779.xml	S26	Introduction	NEG	Furthermore, patients involved in AH are often elderly, presenting with several debilitating comorbidities, or exhibiting autoimmune or neoplastic diseases, with thereby an increased risk of infection because of the intense immunosuppressive impact.
TEST	NEG	PMC5134779.xml	S30	Introduction	NEG	It was recently suggested that in patients treated with corticosteroids alone, the subgroup with FVIII ≥ 1 IU/dL and an INH titer ≤20 Bethesda units per milliliter (BU/mL) was the most likely to obtain partial remission (PR) at 21 days, which is defined by increase in FVIII levels exceeding 50 IU/dL and disappearance of the clinical signs of hemorrhage.[7]
TEST	NEG	PMC5134779.xml	S148	Discussion	NEG	Given that the risk of hemorrhage persists as long as the INH persists, the latter should thereby be eliminated as quickly as possible.
TEST	NEG	PMC5134779.xml	S149	Discussion	NEG	Therefore, it seems to be essential to pinpoint the factors predicting a response to corticosteroids alone in order to identify patients not requiring a potentially harmful increase in immunosuppressive treatments that expose to more severe and frequent infectious processes.
TEST	NEG	PMC5134780.xml	S34	Methods	NEG	The following procedure subtypes were also recorded: unilateral TKA, staged bilateral TKA (different operations during the same hospitalization), and simultaneous bilateral TKA (operation on the same day).
TEST	NEG	PMC5134780.xml	S42	Methods	NEG	Secondary outcome included intraoperative estimated blood loss, perioperative blood transfusion, and postoperative hospital stay.
TEST	NEG	PMC5134780.xml	S47	Methods	NEG	With this method, weights for patients who did not receive antithrombotic agents preoperatively were the inverse of (1 − propensity score) and weights for patients who stopped antithrombotic medication preoperatively were the inverse of the propensity score.
TEST	NEG	PMC5134780.xml	S63	Results	NEG	The incidences of postoperative 30-day complications are presented in Table 3.
TEST	NEG	PMC5134780.xml	S64	Results	NEG	Postoperative cardiovascular complications occurred more frequently in group A compared with group B (P = 0.035).
TEST	NEG	PMC5134780.xml	S84	Discussion	NEG	TKA is most commonly performed for osteoarthritis, and for other knee diseases such as rheumatoid arthritis and psoriatic arthritis.
TEST	NEG	PMC5134780.xml	S99	Discussion	NEG	In principle, evaluating the perioperative complications related to the cessation of antithrombotic therapy requires inclusion of patients who maintain perioperative antithrombotic therapy.
TEST	NEG	PMC5134780.xml	S114	Discussion	NEG	When TKA is planned in patients at high risk of thromboembolism or adverse cardiac events, bridging therapy can be initiated.[19,20]
TEST	POS	PMC5134780.xml	S121	Discussion	NEG	This study has several limitations.
TEST	POS	PMC5134780.xml	S122	Discussion	POS	First, data were collected from a single center; hence, the results can not be generalized for other institutions.
TEST	POS	PMC5134780.xml	S123	Discussion	POS	Furthermore, this study was of a retrospective design, which has inherent weaknesses.
TEST	POS	PMC5134780.xml	S124	Discussion	POS	Larger prospective studies based on multicenter data are required.
TEST	POS	PMC5134780.xml	S125	Discussion	POS	Additionally, there was no transfusion protocol to ensure the consistency of decision-making regarding blood transfusion.
TEST	POS	PMC5134780.xml	S126	Discussion	POS	Thus, surgeons decided the transfusion requirements of the patients on a case-by-case basis.
TEST	POS	PMC5134780.xml	S127	Discussion	POS	Finally, as only a few patients were receiving each antithrombotic agent, with the exception of aspirin, no subgroup analysis according to the type of antithrombotic agents was performed.
TEST	POS	PMC5134780.xml	S128	Discussion	POS	Perioperative outcomes following discontinuation of each type of antithrombotic agent should be further evaluated.
TEST	NEG	PMC5134781.xml	S6	Abstract	NEG	In certain cases, diagnosing LP may be challenging.
TEST	NEG	PMC5134781.xml	S15	Abstract	NEG	After confirmation of this diagnosis by a deep-skin biopsy, our patient was treated with systemic glucocorticoids.
TEST	NEG	PMC5134781.xml	S98	Discussion	NEG	In retrospect, several findings had argued against a bacterial skin infection.
TEST	NEG	PMC5134781.xml	S110	Discussion	NEG	In case series, LP is commonly treated with oral glucocorticoids and hydroxychloroquine.[3]
TEST	NEG	PMC5134796.xml	S24	Introduction	NEG	Symptoms generally begin with coldness of the fingers and toes, and intermittent claudication, then progress to ischemic pain at rest, and ultimately result in the development of ischemic ulcerations and gangrene that can necessitate amputation.[1,2]
TEST	NEG	PMC5134796.xml	S39	Patients and methods	NEG	The sample included eight patients with TA recruited at three hospitals in Barcelona (Spain), all fullfiling the diagnostic criteria proposed by Olin et al[1,2] and Shinoya et al[16]: onset before the age of 50 years; current (or recent past) tobacco use; distal extremity ischemia (infrapopliteal and/or intrabrachial), such as claudication, rest pain, ischemic ulcers, and gangrene documented with noninvasive testing; exclusion of connective tissue diseases and hypercoagulable states; exclusion of a proximal source of emboli with echocardiography and arteriography; and consistent arteriographic findings in the involved and clinically uninvolved limbs including multiple segmental occlusions of distal arterial sections (distally from the elbow and knee); chronic vascular occlusion due to secondary thrombosis; absence of atherosclerotic lesions, such as calcification of vascular walls; tapering and abrupt obstruction of vessels, a twisting course of the involved vessels; and “corkscrew” or “tree-root” collaterals.
TEST	NEG	PMC5134796.xml	S86	Results	NEG	The remaining patient only had ischemic pain at rest in the legs with skin integrity at baseline.
TEST	NEG	PMC5134796.xml	S146	Discussion	POS	In addition, we cannot ignore the pitfalls inherent in any systematic review, including the relatively small number of identified patients, the retrospective design, and incomplete follow-up data in some cases.
TEST	NEG	PMC5134797.xml	S72	Discussion	NEG	Davis et al[8] found that active pulmonary tuberculosis mainly presented high uptake of F-18 FDG, whereas treated or obsolete pulmonary tuberculosis mainly presented nonuptake or mild/intermediate uptake of F-18 FDG (SUV < 2.5).
TEST	NEG	PMC5134797.xml	S78	Discussion	NEG	The expression of Glut-1 and Glut-3 in these pathological tissues was detected, and these results indicated low F-18 FDG uptake and low expression of Glut-1 and Glut-3 in most of the inflammatory lesions.
TEST	NEG	PMC5134797.xml	S93	Discussion	NEG	This finding might be due to the down-regulated Glut receptors on the cell membrane of the inflammatory cells, the smaller amount of inflammatory cells and the fibroblasts as a main cell component in larger lesions.
TEST	NEG	PMC5134797.xml	S97	Conclusion	NEG	Some of the pulmonary inflammatory lesions with F-18 FDG uptake can cause false positive results of PET tumor imaging.
TEST	NEG	PMC5134798.xml	S10	Abstract	NEG	The diameters of right radial artery and ulnar artery were measured by ultrasound on admission and before artery puncture.
TEST	NEG	PMC5134798.xml	S12	Abstract	NEG	Secondary endpoints were the number of difficult procedures, and the incidence of puncture failure.
TEST	NEG	PMC5134798.xml	S17	Abstract	NEG	In addition, the proportion of difficult procedures of UC group was less than that of standard group (4.61% vs 10.92%, P = 0.013).
TEST	NEG	PMC5134798.xml	S68	Methods	NEG	Puncture failure was defined as the guidewire failed to insert.
TEST	POS	PMC5134798.xml	S123	Discussion	POS	This study is limited by its single-center study design; therefore, our findings should primarily be viewed as hypothesis generating.
TEST	POS	PMC5134798.xml	S124	Discussion	POS	Despite the use of an observer and the lab timer, we cannot exclude a bias in the performance, measurement, or recording of the procedure or clinical data.
TEST	POS	PMC5134798.xml	S125	Discussion	POS	The second, the open-label design may increase the possibility of bias.
TEST	POS	PMC5134798.xml	S126	Discussion	POS	That is, patients or operators may be influenced by their knowledge of the procedure.
TEST	NEG	PMC5134799.xml	S24	Introduction	NEG	During the past 2 decades, numerous epidemiological studies have investigated the relationships of the MTHFR C677T and A1298C polymorphisms with various diseases, including birth defects, cardiovascular diseases, pregnancy complications, lymphoblastic leukemia, rheumatoid arthritis, and breast cancer, although the results were still inconsistent.[1,9–15]
TEST	NEG	PMC5134799.xml	S46	Methods	NEG	After obtaining due informed consent, buccal smears were collected, dried at room temperature for 1 hour, and then sent to the central laboratory in Shanghai.

TEST	NEG	PMC5134799.xml	S99	Discussion	NEG	The mean frequency of the CT/AC genotype in our study was 13.7%, which is similar to that of Mexicans, but lower than that of Turks, French, and Italians, and higher than that of Africans.[30–33]
TEST	NEG	PMC5134800.xml	S3	Abstract	NEG	The aim of this study was to investigate the long-term results of computed tomography (CT)-guided percutaneous radiofrequency thermocoagulation (PRT) for glossopharyngeal neuralgia (GPN).
TEST	NEG	PMC5134800.xml	S49	Methods	NEG	The glossopharyngeal was thermally coagulated with radiofrequency at 70°C to 85°C for 120 to 180 seconds, depending on the stimulation reaction and experience of the physician.
TEST	NEG	PMC5134800.xml	S50	Methods	NEG	Hemodynamics was carefully monitored during such interventional procedure.
TEST	NEG	PMC5134800.xml	S62	Results	NEG	At the time of hospital discharge, 63 (78.8%) patients were pain-free.
TEST	NEG	PMC5134801.xml	S82	Discussion	NEG	These diseases may often cause life-threatening complications requiring admission to ICU[13,14] depending on several factors: the exposure to external agents, mostly infections, the therapy, which usually results in immunosuppression, and the comorbidities of the patient.[13,15]
TEST	NEG	PMC5134801.xml	S91	Discussion	NEG	The BVAS/WG is a score designed to measure the level of disease activity, by identifying all the possible organ clinical manifestations.
TEST	NEG	PMC5134801.xml	S117	Discussion	NEG	Nevertheless, satisfactory and definitive results have not been obtained regarding candidate molecules and scores to predict the outcome of patients with vasculitis admitted to ICU.
TEST	NEG	PMC5134801.xml	S126	Discussion	POS	It is important to note that the BVAS was not originally designed for patients admitted to the intensive care and with life-threatening complications.
TEST	NEG	PMC5134802.xml	S7	Abstract	NEG	All patients were divided into subgroup according to the ADAMTS-7 median in this cohort: high group with ADAMTS-7 ≥0.99 ng/mL and low group with ADAMTS-7 <0.99 ng/mL.
TEST	NEG	PMC5134802.xml	S14	Abstract	NEG	Kaplan–Meier analysis showed patients in the high plasma ADAMTS-7 group tend to have a lower event-free survival rate than patients in the low plasma ADAMTS-7 group, unfortunately, no difference was detected (86.8% vs 88.0%, log rank = 0.314, P = 0.575).
TEST	NEG	PMC5134802.xml	S28	Introduction	NEG	However, its value to predict major adverse cardiovascular event (MACE) was validated in stable CAD patients.[9]

TEST	NEG	PMC5134802.xml	S119	Results	NEG	As shown in Table 4, the Syntax score were significantly positively correlated with smoking (r = 0.214, P = 0.004), diabetes history (r = 0.196, P = 0.008), plasma UA levels (r = 0.421, P < 0.001), fasting blood glucose (FBG) (r = 0.168, P = 0.024), CAC score (r = 0.305, P < 0.001), number of diseased vessels (r = 0.667, P < 0.001), and MACE (r = 0.238, P = 0.001).
TEST	POS	PMC5134802.xml	S159	Discussion	POS	The present study is a single-center, retrospective study with its inherent limitations.
TEST	POS	PMC5134802.xml	S160	Discussion	POS	First, a relative small number of patients were enrolled.
TEST	POS	PMC5134802.xml	S161	Discussion	POS	Second, it was a cross-sectional study.
TEST	POS	PMC5134802.xml	S162	Discussion	POS	It is very difficult for us to set completely healthy population as control group, so it could not deduce a casual connection.
TEST	POS	PMC5134802.xml	S163	Discussion	POS	Moreover, there is no established reference of plasma ADAMTS-7 level available from large-scale clinical trials among the same patient population so the cutoff value in the present study is purely suggestive.
TEST	POS	PMC5134802.xml	S164	Discussion	POS	Finally, large sample size and better design studies including detailed information such as imaging intravascular ultrasound data are required to further evaluate the potential mechanisms involving the role of ADAMTS-7.

TEST	NEG	PMC5134805.xml	S67	Methods	NEG	When the linearity hypothesis was not respected, continuous variables were transformed into ordered data.
TEST	NEG	PMC5134805.xml	S94	Results	NEG	In the group of patients who experienced viral reactivations, 10 year-OS was 63% (95% CI 49–74) compared with 41% (95% CI 27–55) in the group of patients without reactivation (P = 0.10) (Fig. 1D).
TEST	NEG	PMC5134805.xml	S102	Discussion	NEG	The mechanisms by which viral reactivations and relapse prevention could be linked remain unclear.
TEST	NEG	PMC5134806.xml	S7	Abstract	NEG	But far less published literature focus on the imaging characteristics of AMFB.
TEST	NEG	PMC5134806.xml	S70	Discussion	NEG	After administration of intravenous contrast medium, AAM shows strong enhancement with swirled central strands of hypointense tissue caused by stretching of the fibrovascular stroma during protrusion.[9]
TEST	NEG	PMC5134806.xml	S74	Discussion	NEG	Hypointensity in T2-weighted images and spoke wheel pattern of enhancement are the typical imaging features of SFT.[12]
TEST	NEG	PMC5134806.xml	S79	Discussion	NEG	The diagnosis of AMFB is based on several findings including clinical, radiological, and histological data.
TEST	NEG	PMC5134807.xml	S82	Methods	NEG	PCR products were purified by using the QIAquick PCR Purification Kit (QIAGEN) and quantified with low DNA Mass ladder (Gibco).
TEST	NEG	PMC5134807.xml	S145	Discussion	NEG	Saliva proved to be a particularly convenient source for virus detection in asymptomatic HHV-8 infection, despite intermittent viral salivary shedding and low HHV-8 load in absence of the KS tumor.[25,27,45,46]
TEST	POS	PMC5134807.xml	S171	Discussion	NEG	Our study, however, has some limitations.
TEST	POS	PMC5134807.xml	S172	Discussion	POS	First, it was not possible to obtain serially CD4 count and HIV viral load, so it would be very useful to verify some additional relationship with clinical progression of KS.
TEST	POS	PMC5134807.xml	S173	Discussion	POS	Second, the limited number of samples analyzed precludes detailed investigation on the impact of ethnicity on HHV-8 genotypes.
TEST	NEG	PMC5134807.xml	S177	Conclusion	NEG	However, it was possible to suggest that genotype B might be associated with better tumor prognosis in the KS group.

TEST	NEG	PMC5134811.xml	S67	Methods	NEG	The MMSE assesses orientation to time and place, attention, calculation and construction, learning, language, and memory, with a range of 0 to 30.[13] Higher scores indicate better performance.
TEST	NEG	PMC5134811.xml	S74	Methods	NEG	The association between cumulative SBP and MMSE score was analyzed using a multivariate linear regression.
TEST	NEG	PMC5134811.xml	S87	Results	NEG	For the 2211 participants, the mean age was 51.04 ± 10.56 years.
TEST	NEG	PMC5134812.xml	S3	Abstract	NEG	The aim of the study was to evaluate dynamic contrast-enhanced breast magnetic resonance imaging (DCE-MRI) features for the prediction of early and late recurrences in patients with breast cancer.
TEST	NEG	PMC5134812.xml	S12	Introduction	NEG	Breast cancer is one of the most common causes of cancer-related death in women worldwide.[1]
TEST	NEG	PMC5134812.xml	S47	Materials and methods	NEG	Standard subtraction images were obtained by subtracting the precontrast images from the second dynamic series (or early peak) of postcontrast images on a pixel-by-pixel basis.
TEST	NEG	PMC5134812.xml	S58	Materials and methods	NEG	A region of interest (ROI) was placed on the fastest-enhancing area or the area showing the most suspicious washout curve pattern of the lesion.
TEST	NEG	PMC5134812.xml	S88	Materials and methods	NEG	Univariate analysis was performed to compare DCE-MRI and clinico-pathologic features between no recurrence and early or late recurrence groups using the log-rank test.
TEST	NEG	PMC5134812.xml	S105	Results	NEG	For clinico-pathologic variables (Table 1), only HER-2 status significantly differed between early and late recurrence.
TEST	NEG	PMC5134812.xml	S112	Results	NEG	Among the tested clinico-pathologic variables (Table 3), stage III, T stage ≥ T2, N stage ≥ N2, ER negativity, PR negativity, Ki-67 positivity, histologic grade III, and nuclear grade III were significantly associated with overall recurrence.
TEST	NEG	PMC5134812.xml	S115	Results	NEG	Among the tested DCE-MRI features (Table 4), moderate or marked BPE (hazard ratio [HR], 2.13; 95% confidence interval [CI], 1.35–3.37), rim enhancement (HR, 3.56; 95% CI, 2.27–5.60), and prominent increased ipsilateral whole-breast vascularity (HR, 4.44; 95% CI, 2.52–7.80) were significantly associated with overall recurrence.
TEST	NEG	PMC5134812.xml	S145	Discussion	NEG	One possibility is that angiogenic stimulation by breast cancer involves not only microvessels, but also larger vessels.
TEST	NEG	PMC5134812.xml	S165	Discussion	NEG	However, DCE-MRI is a noninvasive imaging modality for preoperative evaluation of tumor characteristics and staging through tumor vascularity.
TEST	POS	PMC5134812.xml	S167	Discussion	NEG	This study has some limitations.
TEST	POS	PMC5134812.xml	S168	Discussion	POS	First, this study included a small number of patients with breast cancer recurrence from a single institution.
TEST	POS	PMC5134812.xml	S169	Discussion	POS	Therefore, our patients might not be representative of the general population.
TEST	POS	PMC5134812.xml	S170	Discussion	POS	Second, this study was retrospective and the follow-up period was not long enough (median follow-up, 62.3 months), considering that the luminal subtype of breast cancer may recur even after 10 years.
TEST	POS	PMC5134812.xml	S171	Discussion	POS	Third, 13% of the eligible 694 patients were lost to follow-up, which might have introduced bias.
TEST	POS	PMC5134812.xml	S172	Discussion	NEG	However, no significant difference was found between the group of loss to follow-up and the enrolled group in clinico-pathologic features except patient age.
TEST	POS	PMC5134812.xml	S173	Discussion	NEG	The age difference between 2 groups would be unlikely to affect the study results.
TEST	POS	PMC5134812.xml	S174	Discussion	POS	Fourth, we did not evaluate the status of adjuvant hormonal therapy or adjuvant chemotherapy, which could have affected the recurrence period.
TEST	POS	PMC5134812.xml	S175	Discussion	POS	Lastly, MR imaging was not scheduled according to the women's menstrual cycles, which could have affected the BPE.
TEST	POS	PMC5134812.xml	S176	Discussion	NEG	Although scheduling of screening MR imaging in the second week of a woman's menstrual cycle is routinely recommended to minimize the effect of BPE, diagnostic MR imaging for staging of breast cancer is usually performed regardless of the menstrual cycle.
TEST	NEG	PMC5134813.xml	S48	Introduction	NEG	The patient underwent CT-guided biopsy of sacrum that confirmed presence of angiosarcoma showing vasoformative regions and confirmed as endothelial in origin by immunohistochemistry (CD31) (Fig. 2).
TEST	NEG	PMC5134813.xml	S53	Introduction	NEG	The histological findings were highly suggestive of epithelioid angiosarcoma.
TEST	NEG	PMC5134813.xml	S132	Discussion	NEG	From these 4 findings, other possible complications can arise, including pneumothorax, hydropneumothorax, and pneumomediastinum.
TEST	NEG	PMC5134813.xml	S146	Discussion	NEG	In our case 1, we identified small centrilobular nodules with tree-in bud pattern, which did not involve airways, and was consistent with of endovascular and perivascular spread/growth of small tumor emboli.
TEST	NEG	PMC5134814.xml	S6	Abstract	NEG	Serum Tg, thyroid-stimulating hormone (TSH), thyroid peroxidase antibody (TPOAb), Tg antibody (TgAb), and urinary iodine concentration (UIC) were measured.
TEST	NEG	PMC5134814.xml	S9	Abstract	NEG	No significant differences in Tg were found between genders or among different reference groups.
TEST	NEG	PMC5134814.xml	S11	Abstract	NEG	In adults from regions with adequate and more than adequate iodine intake, we found that Tg may be a suitable marker of iodine status; gender-specific Tg RI was unnecessary; there was no difference between Tg RIs in regions with adequate and more than adequate iodine intake; and the TSH criterion for selecting the Tg reference population could follow the local TSH reference rather than 0.5 to 2.0 mIU/L.
TEST	NEG	PMC5134814.xml	S56	Methods	NEG	The research protocols were carefully explained.
TEST	NEG	PMC5134814.xml	S63	Results	NEG	A total of 1157 subjects (515 men, 642 women, aged 44.9 ± 15.2 years) from Guangzhou and 160 subjects (63 men, 97 women, aged 29.1 ± 6.4 years) from Nanjing were enrolled.
TEST	NEG	PMC5134814.xml	S79	Results	NEG	There was no difference between these 2 RIs, as determined by either the Mann–Whitney U test using the original Tg value (P = 0.304), or by the t test using the transformed Tg value (P = 0.336).
TEST	POS	PMC5134814.xml	S129	Discussion	NEG	The current study had several limitations.
TEST	POS	PMC5134814.xml	S130	Discussion	POS	First, the thyroid indexes did not include serum triiodothyronine (T3) or thyroxine (T4).
TEST	POS	PMC5134814.xml	S131	Discussion	NEG	Although the NACB guideline for Tg RI determination does not require these parameters, there may be certain individuals who have TSH levels within the reference values but abnormal T3 or T4 levels.
TEST	POS	PMC5134814.xml	S132	Discussion	POS	Second, there were more women than men in this study (male:female ≈ 1:2), because in China, women are usually more concerned about health, and as such, are willing to participate in these type of studies.
TEST	POS	PMC5134814.xml	S133	Discussion	NEG	However, because no significant differences in Tg levels were found between genders, this gender-specific imbalance of Tg seemed to have minor effects on our conclusions.
TEST	POS	PMC5134814.xml	S134	Discussion	POS	Finally, this is a cross-sectional study; thus, the causal relationship between Tg and iodine intake could not be well established.
TEST	NEG	PMC5134815.xml	S6	Abstract	NEG	The data were taken from the 2012–2012 Korea National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey.
TEST	NEG	PMC5134815.xml	S23	Introduction	NEG	Also, there was a significant decrease in all-cause mortality by 4% per tooth loss.
TEST	NEG	PMC5134815.xml	S26	Introduction	NEG	Two mechanisms have been suggested for the influence of tooth loss on general health or mortality: inflammation and malnutrition.[6–8]
TEST	NEG	PMC5134815.xml	S30	Introduction	NEG	Poor dentition attenuates mastication efficiency and causes subsequent self-limiting food selection with a diet devoid of fruits, vegetables, and other foods containing key nutrients.
TEST	NEG	PMC5134815.xml	S47	Material and methods	NEG	The Institutional Review Board of the Korean Center for Disease Control and Prevention approved this study (2008-04EXP-01-C, 2009-01CON-03-2C, and 2010-02CON-21-C), and it was accomplished according to the Helsinki Declaration's Ethical Principles for Medical Research Involving Human Subjects.
TEST	NEG	PMC5134815.xml	S71	Material and methods	NEG	The frequency of daily tooth brushing was defined as the mean number of times brushing the teeth in a day.
TEST	NEG	PMC5134815.xml	S112	Discussion	NEG	In this study, maxillary or anterior teeth remained longer than did mandibular or posterior teeth.
TEST	NEG	PMC5134815.xml	S120	Discussion	NEG	The present study also showed that almost 87% of adults brushed their teeth more than twice daily.
TEST	POS	PMC5134815.xml	S140	Discussion	NEG	The present study had several limitations.
TEST	POS	PMC5134815.xml	S141	Discussion	POS	The first is that this study was based on a cross-sectional survey; it is thus difficult to demonstrate a causal relationship between oral health behavior, sociodemographic variables, and the number of remaining teeth based on the study.
TEST	POS	PMC5134815.xml	S142	Discussion	POS	Second, this study was performed in only 1 Asian country.
TEST	POS	PMC5134815.xml	S143	Discussion	POS	Multicenter and longitudinal cohort studies are required to ensure the high-level reliability of the results.
TEST	POS	PMC5134815.xml	S144	Discussion	NEG	This study also has some strengths, though.
TEST	POS	PMC5134815.xml	S145	Discussion	NEG	This study analyzed a representative sample of the entire Korean adult population, and to the best of our knowledge, this is the first report to investigate number of remaining teeth among the administrative districts of South Korea.
TEST	POS	PMC5134815.xml	S146	Discussion	NEG	Moreover, this study revealed that location of remaining teeth had pattern according to socioeconomic status.
TEST	POS	PMC5134815.xml	S147	Discussion	NEG	This study also investigated the timing of tooth brushing in detail, from before breakfast to before bedtime.
TEST	NEG	PMC5134816.xml	S53	Materials and methods	NEG	1,25-Dihydroxyvitamin D3 (1,25-(OH)2D3) (ng/mL) was measured by radioimmunoassay.
TEST	NEG	PMC5134816.xml	S81	Materials and methods	NEG	The Minnesota multiphasic personality inventory-2 (MMPI-2): a standardized psychometric test of adult personality and psychopathology.
TEST	NEG	PMC5134816.xml	S85	Materials and methods	NEG	This cut-off score indicates distinct psychological problems or pathology.
TEST	POS	PMC5134816.xml	S186	Discussion	POS	This study is a pivotal study, conducted in relatively small cohort of CKD patients; therefore, a larger population is requested to confirm our results.
TEST	POS	PMC5134816.xml	S187	Discussion	POS	Also, all patients were on therapies with calcium, calcitriol, and phosphate binders and their treatments could have confounded the results.
TEST	POS	PMC5134816.xml	S188	Discussion	POS	It seems that future large-scale studies are needed to clarify these differences.
TEST	NEG	PMC5134818.xml	S13	Introduction	NEG	While cigarette smoking is a major risk factor for lung cancer, other factors such as family history of lung cancer, prior diagnosis of malignant tumor, occupational exposure to asbestos, and pre-existing lung disease such as chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) can also increase the risk of lung cancer.[1,2]
TEST	NEG	PMC5134818.xml	S16	Introduction	NEG	However, studies to determine the relationship between quantitatively assessed emphysema and lung cancer have shown conflicting results[5–8]: Several studies performed on different lung cancer screening groups failed to show correlations between quantitative computed tomographic (CT) measurements of emphysema and lung cancer[5–7]; however, a recent study on a larger population of National Lung Cancer Screening Trial (NLST) showed a correlation between quantitative CT measures of emphysema and lung cancer risk.[8]
TEST	NEG	PMC5134818.xml	S24	Methods	NEG	The requirement for informed consent from patients was waived because this was a HIPA A compliant retrospective study.
TEST	NEG	PMC5134818.xml	S47	Methods	NEG	Borders of each lung, fissures, and central airways were detected automatically.
TEST	NEG	PMC5134818.xml	S60	Methods	POS	This was considered as a technical failure.
TEST	NEG	PMC5134818.xml	S85	Results	NEG	The emphysema ratio in smokers and ex-smokers was significantly higher than that in never smokers (6.4 ± 5.1% vs 2.8 ± 1.6%, P = 0.002).
TEST	NEG	PMC5134818.xml	S87	Results	NEG	The most frequent location of lung cancer was the left upper lobe (LUL, n = 28, 35.9%), followed by the right upper lobe (RUL, n = 27, 34.6%), left lower lobe (LLL, n = 13, 16.7%), right lower lobe (RLL, n = 9, 11.5%), and right middle lobe (RML, n = 1, 1.3%).
TEST	NEG	PMC5134818.xml	S102	Discussion	NEG	Because of the common pathogenic process of the 2 disease entities and heterogeneous distribution of emphysema in the lungs, it has been postulated that regional severity of emphysema may determine the location of lung cancer.
TEST	NEG	PMC5134818.xml	S111	Discussion	NEG	However, lobar distribution of emphysema is significantly different from the distribution between the upper and lower halves of the lungs divided by a transverse plane.
TEST	NEG	PMC5134818.xml	S118	Discussion	NEG	In their study, the population was skewed toward lower percentage values of emphysema.
TEST	NEG	PMC5134818.xml	S122	Discussion	NEG	Our results are in agreement with previous studies.[21–23]
TEST	NEG	PMC5134818.xml	S126	Discussion	NEG	The odds of lung cancer in the lobes with more severe emphysema (lobar emphysema ratio ranked 1st or 2nd) was 2.48 than the other lobes with less severe emphysema (lobar emphysema ratio ranked 3rd, 4th, or 5th), which was higher than the odds of lung cancer according to lobar location.
TEST	POS	PMC5134818.xml	S131	Discussion	NEG	This study had several limitations.
TEST	POS	PMC5134818.xml	S132	Discussion	POS	First, the study population was relatively small and predominantly male.
TEST	POS	PMC5134818.xml	S133	Discussion	POS	Results might be different in a larger population.
TEST	POS	PMC5134818.xml	S134	Discussion	POS	Second, most patients with severe emphysema were not included in the study group because most of them had conditions (such as pneumonia, pleural effusion, and lung atelectasis) that might affect measurement of lung volume or emphysema.
TEST	POS	PMC5134818.xml	S135	Discussion	POS	This might affect the statistical analysis.
TEST	POS	PMC5134818.xml	S136	Discussion	NEG	In a previous study, no dose–response effect of emphysema on the risk of lung cancer was found in patients with severe emphysema.[4]
TEST	POS	PMC5134818.xml	S137	Discussion	POS	Thus, including patients with severe emphysema could weaken the relationship between lobar emphysema quantity and lung cancer.
TEST	POS	PMC5134818.xml	S138	Discussion	POS	Third, we excluded patients with whole-lung emphysema ratios less than 1%.
TEST	POS	PMC5134818.xml	S139	Discussion	POS	In addition, some patients were excluded following lobe segmentation failure due to technical reasons.
TEST	POS	PMC5134818.xml	S140	Discussion	POS	These factors could act as a selection bias.
TEST	POS	PMC5134818.xml	S141	Discussion	POS	Fourth, we did not analyze subjects according to specific types of lung cancer.
TEST	POS	PMC5134818.xml	S142	Discussion	POS	It is possible that some types of lung cancer are more likely to be affected by emphysema than other types.[26]
TEST	NEG	PMC5134845.xml	S7	Abstract	NEG	All discs were morphologically assessed based on the Pfirrmann grade, and regions of interests (ROIs) were drawn over the T2∗ mapping.

TEST	NEG	PMC5134845.xml	S68	Materials and methods	NEG	In addition, boxplot and receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curves were generated.
TEST	NEG	PMC5134845.xml	S105	Discussion	NEG	Third, the T2 value in the IVD is known to be sensitive to water content and the composition of the collagen network structure.
TEST	NEG	PMC5134847.xml	S51	Methods	NEG	Particularly, AEs were collected for 72 hours following the first injection of rabies vaccines through telephone interview.
TEST	NEG	PMC5134847.xml	S90	Discussion	NEG	Then, we compared respectively Vaccine B with Vaccines A, C, and D for children who were ≤5 years old.
TEST	NEG	PMC5134847.xml	S102	Discussion	NEG	In early periods, animal vaccines were made by cell cultivation in roller bottle.
TEST	NEG	PMC5134847.xml	S104	Discussion	NEG	The numerous advantages of bioreactor mode include simple operation, high volumetric productivity, and low costs.[14]
TEST	NEG	PMC5134848.xml	S3	Abstract	NEG	The National Health Service (NHS) is facing financial constraints and thus there is considerable interest in ensuring the shortest but optimal hospital stays possible.
TEST	NEG	PMC5134848.xml	S21	Introduction	NEG	The accepted “ideal” LOS resulting from optimal surgery and enhanced recovery programmes is deemed to be 5 days or fewer.
TEST	NEG	PMC5134848.xml	S25	Introduction	NEG	Reliably identifying institutions with “outlying” practice is, however, difficult for several reasons.[6]
TEST	NEG	PMC5134848.xml	S105	Results	NEG	This model was used to generate risk-unadjusted and risk-adjusted funnel plots investigating the proportion of patients experiencing an optimal LOS across all the English colorectal MDTs managing these patients (Fig. 2A and B).
TEST	NEG	PMC5134850.xml	S4	Abstract	NEG	This deficit could be associated with the development of late diabetic complications, especially macroangiopathy.
TEST	NEG	PMC5134850.xml	S166	Abstract	NEG	We need to perform further studies on giving magnesium supplements in diabetic children with hypomagnesemia to observe the effect of correction of serum magnesium on glycemic control, lipid profile, and the risk of diabetic complications.
TEST	NEG	PMC5134850.xml	S61	Methods	NEG	Children with persistent diarrhea and vomiting.
TEST	NEG	PMC5134850.xml	S127	Discussion	NEG	This is considered supportive to our results as we found that hypomagnesemia is seen mainly in T1DM children with longer duration of diabetes.
TEST	NEG	PMC5134850.xml	S132	Discussion	NEG	This agreed with Galli and Maggana [17] on Athens type I diabetic children that showed a lower Mg level in patients with poor glycemic control with high HbA1c.
TEST	NEG	PMC5134850.xml	S149	Discussion	NEG	Guerrero-Romero and Rodríguez-Morán[37] showed that in patients with T2DM, hypomagnesemia is linked with low levels of HDL, irrespective of serum glucose level.
TEST	NEG	PMC5134850.xml	S158	Discussion	NEG	This disagreement could be explained by different study populations between their studies and ours.
TEST	POS	PMC5134850.xml	S169	Conclusion	NEG	Several limitations of this study deserve mentioning.
TEST	POS	PMC5134850.xml	S170	Conclusion	POS	First, we did not measure erythrocyte magnesium content.
TEST	POS	PMC5134850.xml	S171	Conclusion	POS	As magnesium is a predominantly intracellular ion, its serum measurements are not representative of magnesium status or intracellular pool.
TEST	POS	PMC5134850.xml	S172	Conclusion	NEG	In this regard, significant intracellular magnesium depletion could be seen with normal serum concentrations[39]; however, because we already having a higher percentage of hypomagnesaemia in serum of our diabetic patients compared to our control subjects, this potential limitation did not influence our objective and conclusions.
TEST	POS	PMC5134850.xml	S173	Conclusion	POS	Second we did not randomize our patients, instead, we took all patients coming consecutively to our outpatient Endocrinology unit.
TEST	POS	PMC5134850.xml	S174	Conclusion	NEG	However, because we have a good number of patients with age and sex matched control, this potential limitation did not influence our objective and conclusions.
TEST	POS	PMC5134850.xml	S175	Conclusion	POS	We recommend performing further multicenter studies on different populations with different levels of glycemic control in order to get more accurate results regarding the relationship between serum and intracellular magnesium in children with type 1Diabetes.

TEST	NEG	PMC5134851.xml	S137	Discussion	NEG	Propaganda needs of patients focused on 11 kinds of ways (Fig. 1), in which a higher proportion of opinions such as “hospital site,” “Doctor's personal blog, we-chat” and other comments were easy to implement as medical institutions and individual doctors.
TEST	NEG	PMC5134851.xml	S146	Discussion	NEG	Different with health insurance in other countries, ATR-related health care costs will be borne entirely by the patients themselves, in China.

TEST	NEG	PMC5134865.xml	S113		NEG	From a socio-economic perspective, the Korean National Health Service does not reimburse costs for diabetes self-management education or home supplies, such as lancets, needles, and blood glucose test strips and this barrier may hinder diabetic patients from performing SMBG or receiving diabetes self-management training.
TEST	POS	PMC5134865.xml	S137		NEG	This study had several limitations.
TEST	POS	PMC5134865.xml	S138		POS	First, this was a case–control study in which the subjects were enrolled from a single tertiary center, which may have resulted in selection bias, and thus the results may not be generalizable to all patients with diabetes.
TEST	POS	PMC5134865.xml	S139		POS	Although we adjusted for a wide range of variables to identify risk factors for HMA in 2 groups that were comparable in terms of age, sex, and duration of diagnosed diabetes, the results may still be confounded by unmeasured factors.
TEST	POS	PMC5134865.xml	S140		POS	Second, because we designated the NSH group as patients with documented hypoglycemia, this group might include more individuals diagnosed via SMBG compared with the HMA group.
TEST	POS	PMC5134865.xml	S141		POS	Some of the patients with sequelae due to severe hypoglycemia did not revisit the hospital following their discharge, and thus, their long-term sequelae could not be evaluated.

TEST	NEG	PMC5134871.xml	S149		NEG	The biomarkers cyclin A and AMACR only showed a minimal drop or no drop in AUC after exclusion (cyclin A: 0.003 and AMACR: 0.0).
TEST	NEG	PMC5134871.xml	S153		NEG	In this large case–control study we evaluated the value of cyclin A expression for predicting neoplastic progression in patients with BE.
TEST	NEG	PMC5134871.xml	S160		NEG	Previous studies demonstrated repeatedly the value of LGD as a risk factor for neoplastic progression, albeit with a low predictive value due to sampling error and considerable interobserver variation.[4,6,12–15]

TEST	POS	PMC5134871.xml	S190		NEG	In spite of this, our previous studies have shown good interobserver agreement for both p53 and SOX2 and they were relatively simple and straightforward to interpret.[17,18]
TEST	POS	PMC5134871.xml	S191		POS	Further validation of this panel of biomarkers in large prospective studies is required to confirm our findings.
TEST	POS	PMC5134871.xml	S192		POS	Secondly, as all patients with BE, the patients considered as controls in this study still have the potential to progress to HGD or EAC during the future follow-up.
TEST	POS	PMC5134871.xml	S193		POS	However, since their median follow-up time was 6.5 years (which is more the twice the follow-up time of the cases), and the incidence of progression in only 2.6/1000 patients per year, the chance of progression in the controls is slim.[6]

TEST	POS	PMC5134872.xml	S127	Discussion	NEG	The trend identified in the study should not have been affected by the missing information.
TEST	POS	PMC5134872.xml	S128	Discussion	POS	Second, almost all patients diagnosed as PID would receive treatments in Taiwan, because most residents in Taiwan are covered by NHI program and the treatment fee is free.
TEST	POS	PMC5134872.xml	S129	Discussion	POS	Therefore, it could not differentiate whether no treatment of PID would further increase the risk of secondary malignancy in this study.
TEST	POS	PMC5134872.xml	S130	Discussion	POS	Third, HPV is a cause of cervical cancer, vaginal cancer, vulva cancer and should be incorporated into this secondary malignancy study.
TEST	POS	PMC5134872.xml	S131	Discussion	POS	However, there is no data about HPV vaccination in our NHIRD database because HPV vaccination is still self-paid, not covered by NHI and is therefore not included in NHIRD.

TEST	NEG	PMC5134876.xml	S112		NEG	Thus, the joint involvement pattern of early- and late-onset gout patients differs.
TEST	NEG	PMC5134876.xml	S119		NEG	In the present study, alcohol and high-purine food consumption were significant triggers in both groups, and compared with the late-onset patients, early-onset patients had a slightly but significantly higher proportion of having alcohol consumption, especially beer, as a gout trigger.
TEST	POS	PMC5134876.xml	S141		NEG	This study had several limitations.
TEST	POS	PMC5134876.xml	S142		POS	First, this is a retrospective study and depends on patient-reported responses and therefore there may be misclassification bias, since patients with a longer disease duration tend to not recollect clearly the exact date of onset and frequency of flare in the first year, which might result in bias in our final results.
TEST	POS	PMC5134876.xml	S143		POS	Second, PUMCH is a general medical center, and patients presenting to our clinic usually had a more severe disease, which might have caused patient bias.

TEST	NEG	PMC5134888.xml	S137	Discussion	NEG	Although the BDI contains the 3 domains of functional capability, and magnitudes of task and effort, all are related to activity or exercise intensity.[1]
TEST	NEG	PMC5134888.xml	S148	Discussion	NEG	The SGRQ consists of 3 domains and 50 items, of which 24 are related to activity, exertion, and/or dyspnea[5] (16 are related to activity, and 8 in the impact domain are also related to activities, Supplement 4), so that the SGRQ is correlated with EDS, dyspnea intensity at rest, and 6MWD.
TEST	NEG	PMC5134888.xml	S153	Discussion	NEG	The CAT score consists of only 8 items, with 2 regarding exertion[4] and 6 being related to symptom and impact domains.
TEST	NEG	PMC5134888.xml	S158	Discussion	NEG	Therefore, the CAT may serve as a surrogate for the SGRQ[28] and may predict acute exacerbations.[8]
TEST	POS	PMC5134888.xml	S169	Discussion	POS	This is a cross-sectional study, so the temporal effect on the stability of the response of each tool is unknown despite good reported test-retest reliability.[1,28,34]

TEST	POS	PMC5134888.xml	S172	Discussion	NEG	On the basis of previous reports, 15 to 25 minutes are needed to complete the CRQ[6] and 2 minutes for the CAT.[28]
TEST	POS	PMC5134888.xml	S173	Discussion	POS	The SGRQ is lengthy and complex to score, and the need for recall is also problematic.
TEST	POS	PMC5134888.xml	S174	Discussion	POS	The SGRQ specifically used for patients with COPD (SGRQ-C) removed 10 items from the original form including questions requiring recall; however, it is still lengthy.[35]

TEST	NEG	PMC5136702.xml	S57	Methods	NEG	Following incubation cells were stimulated with dimethyloxalylglycine (DMOG), a pan prolyl hydroxylase inhibitor and dimethyl sulfoxide (DMSO) vehicle control for 2 h.
TEST	NEG	PMC5136702.xml	S58	Methods	NEG	DMOG (HIF1α activator), was used in these experiments to mimic the effect of hypoxia as the Seahorse Analyzer cannot be placed in a hypoxic chamber.

TEST	NEG	PMC5136704.xml	S50	Methods	NEG	The search was conducted in the PubMed (US National Library of Medicine, National Institutes of Health) database, EU Commission website, national competent authorities’ websites and Google sources using the keywords: ethics, guideline, regulations, paediatric, minors, children, biomedical research, clinical trials, human rights and children’s rights.
TEST	NEG	PMC5136704.xml	S51	Methods	NEG	The search resulted in 28 relevant documents related to medical research ethics on humans and, more specifically, on children.
TEST	NEG	PMC5136704.xml	S61	Results	NEG	The definition of these two terms rests on the need of these signatures: either given by the trial subject alone, or in conjunction with the parents/guardians.
TEST	NEG	PMC5136704.xml	S91	Discussion	NEG	Currently, it is not possible to seek European-wide legislative changes for EC practice harmonisation, as the practice for one EC will not necessarily work for another without concerted effort to achieve harmony.
TEST	NEG	PMC5136716.xml	S21	Introduction	NEG	The cause is not well understood; there is a significant genetic component, but only a minority of cases are due to single-gene mutations.2
TEST	NEG	PMC5136716.xml	S23	Introduction	NEG	It is therefore difficult to advise a patient on how long they may expect to live, and on the uncertainty in this prediction, and not every patient wants detailed information; nonetheless, for many patients diagnosed with a life-limiting illness, such an estimate is important for providing hope and enabling them to plan their life and its ending, not to mention improving the design and interpretation of clinical trials.
TEST	NEG	PMC5136716.xml	S54	Methods	NEG	Using this model, we could ask whether the predictor variables (age at symptom onset, diagnostic delay, riluzole use) were associated with progression to respiratory muscle weakness, or separately with mortality after respiratory muscle involvement.
TEST	NEG	PMC5136716.xml	S61	Methods	POS	We were not able to estimate this survival benefit using our data, and estimates in the literature vary widely.
TEST	NEG	PMC5136716.xml	S62	Methods	NEG	The largest study is reported by Bourke et al,21 but the authors do not explicitly derive a figure for survival benefit.
TEST	NEG	PMC5136716.xml	S63	Methods	NEG	Fitting exponential distributions to their Kaplan-Meier plots suggests a 3.5-fold survival benefit for NIV (figure 2).
TEST	NEG	PMC5136716.xml	S64	Methods	NEG	On the basis of the clinic audit data, we estimated that 80% of our patients accessed NIV during their illness, and assumed this to be independent of the covariates.
TEST	NEG	PMC5136716.xml	S68	Methods	NEG	The effects of predictor variables on survival can be modelled in two ways: as affecting the chance of death occurring at any particular time (a Cox's proportional hazards model) or as affecting the length of time until death (an accelerated failure time (AFT) model).
TEST	NEG	PMC5136716.xml	S71	Methods	POS	The distribution of times from diagnosis to respiratory involvement could not be visualised directly, but only in the context of the combined model, so the choice of model distribution was arbitrary among those amenable to AFT analysis.
TEST	NEG	PMC5136716.xml	S78	Methods	NEG	The mean was the only parameter which was allowed to depend on the predictor variables of age at symptom onset, diagnostic delay (log transformed) and riluzole use.
TEST	NEG	PMC5136716.xml	S96	Results	NEG	Table 2 shows summary statistics of the variables of interest in the patient groups.
TEST	NEG	PMC5136716.xml	S104	Results	POS	However, because of the relatively small sample size, the CIs are large, and the analysis does not rule out the possibility of clinically important effects.
TEST	NEG	PMC5136716.xml	S132	Discussion	NEG	We present a straightforward graphical method of predicting a patient's survival time from ALS diagnosis, taking into account the known prognostic factors of onset site, age at symptom onset, diagnostic delay, riluzole use, NIV use and respiratory muscle involvement.
TEST	NEG	PMC5136716.xml	S138	Discussion	NEG	We give an explicit, straightforward method which can be applied in the clinic in moments, without specialised tests or detailed calculation.
TEST	NEG	PMC5136716.xml	S151	Discussion	NEG	Since our statistical methods have not been used previously in this context, this provides a check on our methods and indirectly supports the novel findings of this study.
TEST	POS	PMC5136716.xml	S153	Discussion	POS	Like any model, the present study represents a compromise between simplicity and robustness on the one hand, and the faithful representation of reality on the other.
TEST	POS	PMC5136716.xml	S154	Discussion	NEG	There is evidence that patients with upper motor neuron features alone12 or lower motor neuron features alone12 22–24 tend to survive longer, and that those with cognitive impairment,25 neck weakness,26 weight loss at diagnosis6 and certain genotypes27 28 have a higher overall mortality.
TEST	POS	PMC5136716.xml	S155	Discussion	POS	Our study did not include information on these factors.
TEST	POS	PMC5136716.xml	S156	Discussion	POS	In constructing the model, we assumed that the patients did not have respiratory muscle involvement at diagnosis.
TEST	POS	PMC5136716.xml	S157	Discussion	POS	This biases our model slightly towards predicting shorter survival in those without respiratory involvement.
TEST	POS	PMC5136716.xml	S158	Discussion	POS	The basic assumption that respiratory involvement always occurs before death will also have exceptions.
TEST	POS	PMC5136716.xml	S159	Discussion	POS	The availability and use of gastrostomy and NIV may vary between centres, as well as other aspects of care relevant to survival.29
TEST	POS	PMC5136716.xml	S160	Discussion	POS	The model does not take account of such variation.
TEST	POS	PMC5136716.xml	S161	Discussion	POS	Although we tried to avoid bias by using a population-based cohort, one must always be cautious in applying a model to populations other than the one from which it was derived.
TEST	POS	PMC5136716.xml	S162	Discussion	POS	The model is useful for predicting survival at the time of diagnosis, and once respiratory involvement has occurred; the prediction of survival at other times during a patient's illness is not addressed by the model.
TEST	POS	PMC5136716.xml	S163	Discussion	POS	The present study is not a clinical trial, and therefore the effect of riluzole use should be interpreted cautiously as ‘those who receive riluzole survive longer’ rather than as ‘riluzole prolongs survival’, though both are consistent with the data.
TEST	POS	PMC5136716.xml	S164	Discussion	POS	A weakness of this study is that the population studied has a lower median age of onset than is typical for population registers.
TEST	POS	PMC5136716.xml	S165	Discussion	POS	This may reflect underascertainment of older age groups, which would be consistent with the lifetime risk curves previously reported.1 30
TEST	POS	PMC5136716.xml	S166	Discussion	POS	It may alternatively reflect the influence of London, which is a large component of the catchment and being urban, has a younger population than average.
TEST	POS	PMC5136716.xml	S167	Discussion	POS	A further weakness is that the risk curves have been derived in a population study but will be most likely applied in a clinic setting, and clinics have a generally younger, more male population, which may limit its applicability.
TEST	NEG	PMC5136717.xml	S3	Background	NEG	Motor deficit after stroke is related to regional anatomical damage.
TEST	NEG	PMC5136717.xml	S18	Introduction	NEG	A major contributor to upper limb motor deficit is the initial severity of stroke, but a number of other factors appear to be important, not least of which is the infarct location.3
TEST	NEG	PMC5136717.xml	S44	Methods	POS	Note that statistical inferences for the weight maps were not feasible, as a weight map was acquired for each patient subgroup, not for each patient.
TEST	NEG	PMC5136717.xml	S48	Results	NEG	Lesion likelihood maps for the two patient subgroups are shown in figure 1A, B.
TEST	NEG	PMC5136719.xml	S7	Objectives	NEG	IL23R and IL12RB2 mRNA levels in CD4+ T cells were compared between cases homozygous for the AS-risk ‘A’ allele and the protective ‘G’ allele.
TEST	NEG	PMC5136719.xml	S86	Methods	NEG	H19 primers were purchased from Diagenode (Liege, Belgium).
TEST	NEG	PMC5136719.xml	S125	Results	NEG	Binding to the ‘G’ (protective) allele was outcompeted by 100-fold excess of unlabelled ‘G’ (figure 3 and online supplementary figure S3A).
TEST	NEG	PMC5136719.xml	S130	Results	NEG	Addition of TWIST1 antibody to the EMSA reduced/inhibited the formation of the DNA-protein complex for both alleles (figure 3).
TEST	NEG	PMC5136726.xml	S27	Methods	NEG	Patients were recruited from the outpatient clinic for motor neuron diseases at the University Medical Center Utrecht (UMC Utrecht).
TEST	NEG	PMC5136726.xml	S84	Methods	NEG	To investigate whether the ‘C9+’ neuroimaging phenotype was also present within the group of C9− patients with ALS, we subsequently applied the model to the remaining 128 C9− patients with ALS (who were not used to develop the model) to identify those with and without a ‘C9+’ neuroimaging phenotype.
TEST	NEG	PMC5136726.xml	S135	Discussion	NEG	Involvement of the cerebellum in C9+ patients with ALS has been demonstrated by histological studies of C9orf72 pathology.23–26
TEST	NEG	PMC5136726.xml	S138	Discussion	NEG	By offering an intermediate phenotype, neuroimaging might provide the link between factors underlying the pathological mechanisms resulting in particular patterns of neurodegeneration and clinical phenotypes.
TEST	NEG	PMC5137302.xml	S2		NEG	Objective To develop and validate a risk prediction model for venous thromboembolism in the first six weeks after delivery (early postpartum).
TEST	NEG	PMC5137302.xml	S22		NEG	A similar system is used in Sweden,6 which is more conservative than those in the UK and Canada.
TEST	NEG	PMC5137302.xml	S70		NEG	On the basis of an estimated 300 venous thromboembolism events during the first six weeks postpartum and 22 candidate predictors in our derivation cohort, we had an effective sample size of 14 venous thromboembolism events per predictor, above the minimum requirement suggested by Peduzzi et al.22
TEST	NEG	PMC5137302.xml	S112		NEG	She has a predicted risk of 0.11% of developing a VTE within the first six weeks of delivery.
TEST	NEG	PMC5137302.xml	S115		NEG	She had a history of cardiac disease and varicose veins.
TEST	NEG	PMC5137302.xml	S117		NEG	Interpretation: if 1000 women with the same risk factors are followed, 49 will develop VTE within six weeks of childbirth.
TEST	NEG	PMC5137302.xml	S129		NEG	Table 1 summarises the basic characteristics of the study population.
TEST	NEG	PMC5137302.xml	S173		NEG	This is because venous thromboembolism is the leading cause of direct maternity mortality in the UK, and venous thromboembolism related death may be prevented through targeted thromboprophylaxis.
TEST	POS	PMC5137302.xml	S180		POS	However, by excluding women with a history of venous thromboembolism from our study, we may have limited its effect on our estimates.
TEST	POS	PMC5137302.xml	S181		POS	Furthermore, universal screening for some of those risk factors (such as factor V Leiden) is not routinely recommended in pregnant women, so pragmatically it cannot be used to predict the risk of first venous thromboembolism in the wider general population.
TEST	POS	PMC5137302.xml	S182		NEG	The current RCOG thromboprophylaxis guideline recommends risk assessment for venous thromboembolism intrapartum or immediately after childbirth.5
TEST	POS	PMC5137302.xml	S183		NEG	Thus our risk assessment tool can be used to quantify risk of venous thromboembolism during that period.
TEST	POS	PMC5137302.xml	S184		NEG	However, our prediction model should not be used for women with one or more risk factors not measured in our model (for example, immobilisation due to fracture or in general) and should not be relied on to the exclusion of clinical judgment for prescribing thromboprophylaxis.
TEST	POS	PMC5137302.xml	S185		POS	We acknowledge that our model does not take into account disease severity for specific comorbidities owing to data limitations and inadequate number of venous thromboembolism events leading to a lack of power to stratify on disease severity, if known.
TEST	POS	PMC5137302.xml	S186		NEG	However, our prediction model is in line with the existing guidelines that also do not take into account disease severity.
TEST	POS	PMC5137302.xml	S187		NEG	Women who become pregnant are generally healthier and have lower prevalence of pre-existing comorbidities compared with the general population.
TEST	POS	PMC5137302.xml	S188		NEG	In our study, the prevalence of heart, kidney, and inflammatory bowel disease was around 1% (even after use of our broad definitions).
TEST	POS	PMC5137302.xml	S189		POS	Thus the proportion of women experiencing severe heart and kidney disease during pregnancy will be even lower, and these women will probably be cared for very differently from those with well controlled comorbidities.
TEST	POS	PMC5137302.xml	S190		POS	We also believe that whereas in theory our model could be improved by ascertaining more detail on the severity of risk factors, this would negatively affect the ability to apply this in practice where information on risk factors will need to be obtained accurately in a relatively short clinical assessment.
TEST	NEG	PMC5137302.xml	S194		NEG	One was based on a weighted risk score for exposures associated with at least a fivefold increase in risk of venous thromboembolism6 34; the other, an individualised risk assessment tool, was based on absolute risks of venous thromboembolism.35
TEST	NEG	PMC5137302.xml	S199		NEG	These guidelines do not take into account the individualised absolute risk of venous thromboembolism based on women’s complex clinical risk profile, and nor have they been externally validated, which is crucial to facilitate their translation into practice.
TEST	NEG	PMC5137302.xml	S211		NEG	Targeted thromboprophylaxis can prevent VTE, but clinical risk prediction of VTE in postpartum women is rudimentary
TEST	NEG	PMC5139145.xml	S17		NEG	While research into respiratory diseases has rewarded us with pharmacological treatments such as inhaled corticosteroids, leukotriene receptor antagonists, β agonists and more recently targeted monoclonal therapies which have helped alleviate the burden of asthma it is only since ca.
TEST	NEG	PMC5139145.xml	S49		NEG	The oral cavity and stomach contained high species richness and the highest bacterial signal levels in comparison to both the nasal cavity and lungs which had much lower bacterial signal levels.
TEST	NEG	PMC5139145.xml	S52		NEG	Unintentional environmental contamination when processing can lead to the unintentional identification of contaminants by the powerful sequencing technologies and controlling potential sources of contamination such as reagents is vital.
TEST	NEG	PMC5139145.xml	S180		NEG	While the role of the gut microbiota in shaping the mucosal immune system, the symbiosis between the gut microbiota and intestinal mucosa, and the importance of barrier function within the gut is well understood, there remains a paucity of information pertaining to the lung [11].
TEST	NEG	PMC5141587.xml	S27	What are the symptoms of influenza?	NEG	Pregnant women, including up to two weeks post-partum
TEST	NEG	PMC5141587.xml	S34	How do influenza epidemics and pandemics occur?	NEG	In tropical and subtropical regions the seasonality of influenza is less well defined (fig 2).24 25
TEST	NEG	PMC5141587.xml	S36	How do influenza epidemics and pandemics occur?	NEG	As most people have no immunity to the new subtype, infection spreads quickly (table 2).
TEST	NEG	PMC5141587.xml	S96	How can influenza be prevented?	NEG	During an outbreak, consider isolation of residents of closed settings for the duration of the infectious period (five days after symptom onset) to limit spread to others.
TEST	NEG	PMC5141641.xml	S23	Background	NEG	Using a microfluidic magnetic activated cell sorting system, our previous study has isolated mouse lung multipotent stem cells (MLSCs) which play an important role in bronchiolar and alveolar epithelial cells injury repair [8].
TEST	NEG	PMC5141641.xml	S94	Methods	NEG	First, rat IgG panning to deplete immunocytes expressing FcR to enrich for alveolar epithelial cells.
TEST	NEG	PMC5141641.xml	S100	Methods	NEG	The cell suspension was applied on a MACS separation column subjected to a magnetic field provided by the MACS separator.
TEST	NEG	PMC5141641.xml	S103	Methods	NEG	To gain high purity of AEC2s, collect T1α-negative cells, incubated with mouse anti-rat EpCAM antibodies (Abcam, USA) for 40 min at 4 °C, and then handle cells as above with rat anti-mouse MicroBead solution.
TEST	NEG	PMC5143210.xml	S9	Background	NEG	Of 4979 patients who met inclusion criteria, we identified 867 Local patients who traveled 2.7 [interquartile range (IQR): 1.6–4 miles] miles to centers that treated 2.6 (IQR: 1.9–3.3) esophageal cancers per year, and 317 Travel patients who traveled 107.1 (IQR: 65–247) miles to centers treating 31.9 (IQR: 30.9–38.5) cases.
TEST	NEG	PMC5145251.xml	S12	Objective	NEG	Overall, 184 patients (20.3%) underwent further contrast-enhanced MRI with other gadolinium-based contrast agents within the 2-year follow-up.
TEST	NEG	PMC5145251.xml	S84	MATERIALS AND METHODS	NEG	On June 2, 2011, the FDA released the pharmaceutical companies manufacturing GBCAs from completing study enrollment but the full 2-year follow-up was required for all patients already enrolled.25
TEST	NEG	PMC5145251.xml	S116	DISCUSSION	NEG	Following the FDA's postmarketing requirement for all US-approved GBCAs,22 we voluntarily initiated this study on gadobutrol adhering to the FDA's proposed study design.
TEST	NEG	PMC5145251.xml	S146	DISCUSSION	NEG	Our results are in accordance with other reports on gadobutrol use in patients with renal impairment.
TEST	NEG	PMC5145252.xml	S31	MATERIALS AND METHODS	NEG	We included consecutive patients who underwent percutaneous CT-guided IRE for ablation of liver malignancies over a 3-year period (2012 through 2015).
TEST	NEG	PMC5145252.xml	S35	MATERIALS AND METHODS	NEG	without prognostically relevant extrahepatic tumor burden, and
TEST	NEG	PMC5145252.xml	S44	MATERIALS AND METHODS	NEG	The standardized pulse sequence protocol is given in Table 1.
TEST	NEG	PMC5145252.xml	S114	RESULTS	NEG	A hyperintense rim with arterial contrast enhancement was visible in 7 cases around the 24 ablation zones and persisted for 3 months in 5 and for 6 months in 2 of the 7 cases.
TEST	NEG	PMC5145252.xml	S143	DISCUSSION	NEG	Since this was observed in all 34 cases with complete ablation, any increase in size of the ablation zone should rise the suspicion of local recurrence.
TEST	POS	PMC5145252.xml	S150	DISCUSSION	NEG	Our study has a number of limitations.
TEST	POS	PMC5145252.xml	S151	DISCUSSION	POS	We dealt with a relatively small group of patients who have various tumor types with different histological aspects in their appearance and may have been treated with different types of systemic therapy before, which may influence the “treatment response,” and may, in principle, influence the MRI appearance of the liver.
TEST	POS	PMC5145252.xml	S152	DISCUSSION	NEG	However, none of our patients exhibited signs of chemotherapy-associated steatohepatitis clinically or at MRI.
TEST	POS	PMC5145252.xml	S153	DISCUSSION	POS	Moreover, we did not investigate the effects of IRE on other imaging methods such as CT or (contrast enhanced) ultrasound.
TEST	POS	PMC5145252.xml	S154	DISCUSSION	NEG	Further studies are needed to establish the process of post-IRE healing in these imaging methods.
TEST	NEG	PMC5152707.xml	S26		NEG	This was a pragmatic parallel randomized controlled trial in low risk patients presenting to the emergency department with a potential acute coronary syndrome.
TEST	NEG	PMC5152707.xml	S36		NEG	Allocation was concealed by an online password protected randomization algorithm (Medidata Balance; Medidata Solutions, New York City, NY).
TEST	NEG	PMC5152707.xml	S43		NEG	We sought to assist patients and clinicians in making a risk informed shared decision in the emergency setting in which patients typically do not have the opportunity to learn about their condition prior to the visit and clinicians often make decisions unilaterally to facilitate patient safety and rapid treatment of life threatening conditions.
TEST	NEG	PMC5152707.xml	S46		NEG	Prior to conducting the trial, we refined the decision aid to ensure contextual fit with each practice setting.
TEST	NEG	PMC5152707.xml	S51		NEG	For patients randomized to the decision aid, a study coordinator collected each of the variables needed to populate the quantitative probability web tool,14 asked the treating clinician to sign off on their accuracy, and calculated the patient’s pretest probability of acute coronary syndrome, incorporating the result of the first troponin test but prior to subsequent biomarker testing (fig 2).
TEST	NEG	PMC5152707.xml	S52		NEG	After selecting the decision aid corresponding to the appropriate level of risk, the study coordinator offered to provide the clinician with a concise refresher of the content.
TEST	NEG	PMC5152707.xml	S58		NEG	As the trial was intentionally pragmatic in design, usual care was not standardized.12
TEST	NEG	PMC5152707.xml	S70		NEG	If patients were unable to be reached by phone or email and no subsequent visits in the electronic medical record were documented, mortality status was verified using Accurint, a national database frequently used by banks and other businesses to track individuals and ensure payment collection.22
TEST	NEG	PMC5152707.xml	S73		NEG	When designing the trial, the patient adviser, caregiver adviser, and emergency department patient advisory council at the Saint Marys Hospital at Mayo Clinic provided input on the prioritization and selection of outcomes.
TEST	NEG	PMC5152707.xml	S91		NEG	The scale ranges from 0-100, where higher values are reflective of higher levels of patient trust in their physician.
TEST	NEG	PMC5152707.xml	S103		NEG	The data were collected by review of the electronic medical record at each participating site.
TEST	NEG	PMC5152707.xml	S113		NEG	The phrase “Test if Chest Pain Choice safely improves validated patient-centered outcome measures” refers to the five additional outcome measures listed as secondary outcomes at clinicaltrials.gov (a through e) and is redundant.
TEST	NEG	PMC5152707.xml	S120		NEG	For continuous outcomes we used linear models, and for categorical outcomes we used multinomial (polytomous) logistic models.
TEST	NEG	PMC5152707.xml	S141		NEG	Patients randomized to the decision aid had greater knowledge (questions correct out of 8: decision aid, 4.2 v usual care, 3.6; mean difference 0.66, 95% confidence interval 0.46 to 0.86; table 2).
TEST	NEG	PMC5152707.xml	S155		NEG	A significantly lower proportion of patients randomized to the decision aid decided, with their clinician, to be admitted to the emergency department observation unit for cardiac stress testing or CCTA (decision aid, 37.3% v usual care, 52.1%; absolute difference 14.8%, 95% confidence interval 1.1% to 13.9%), and a significantly lower proportion underwent cardiac stress testing within 30 days (decision aid, 38.1% v usual care, 45.6%; 7.5%, 1.1% to 13.9%; table 3).
TEST	NEG	PMC5152707.xml	S161		NEG	These patients were admitted to the hospital for further evaluation and management and received a diagnosis of non-ST segment elevation myocardial infarction.
TEST	NEG	PMC5152707.xml	S162		NEG	The fourth case of myocardial infarction in the decision aid arm occurred in a patient who had negative serial cardiac troponin results and no acute ischemic changes on the ECG but symptoms suggestive of acute coronary syndrome.
TEST	NEG	PMC5152707.xml	S163		NEG	This patient was admitted to the hospital, underwent percutaneous coronary intervention, and subsequently developed in-stent thrombosis.
TEST	NEG	PMC5152707.xml	S165		NEG	The patient underwent a second percutaneous coronary intervention and recovered uneventfully.
TEST	NEG	PMC5152707.xml	S179		NEG	Rather, patient centered interventions such as those tested in this trial indicate that patients, when educated and informed of their risk, might choose with their clinician to undergo less extensive evaluation more closely tailored to their personalized risk.
TEST	POS	PMC5152707.xml	S185		NEG	Several limitations of this trial should be taken into consideration.
TEST	POS	PMC5152707.xml	S186		POS	The quantitative pretest probability web tool8 9 only applies to patients with chest pain.
TEST	POS	PMC5152707.xml	S187		POS	As such, the decision aid cannot be used in patients with potential acute coronary syndrome who present with non-chest pain syndromes (eg, shortness of breath, diaphoresis).
TEST	POS	PMC5152707.xml	S188		POS	In addition, more accurate methods to estimate patient risk, such as those incorporating high sensitivity troponin C assays, are likely to become available.
TEST	POS	PMC5152707.xml	S189		NEG	In the future it might be preferable to generate risk estimates with these methods and select the decision aid that corresponds to this level of risk.
TEST	POS	PMC5152707.xml	S190		NEG	We used two versions of the decision aid in the trial—one that included the option of coronary computed tomography angiography (CCTA) and one that included only cardiac stress testing.
TEST	POS	PMC5152707.xml	S191		POS	Although this introduced a degree of heterogeneity in the intervention, the trial was intentionally pragmatic in design, and contextual fit of the decision aid to facilitate clinician-patient discussions relevant to the clinical settings enrolling patients in the trial was essential.
TEST	POS	PMC5152707.xml	S192		NEG	In addition, evidence now supports application of the shared decision making tool in clinical care contexts where CCTA is frequently used and in practice settings where cardiac stress testing is more commonly used.
TEST	POS	PMC5152707.xml	S193		POS	We randomized at the patient level, increasing the risk of contamination between intervention and control groups.
TEST	POS	PMC5152707.xml	S194		NEG	To limit the risk of contamination, the quantitative pretest probability web tool was password protected, and coordinators did not provide clinicians access to the decision aid.
TEST	POS	PMC5152707.xml	S195		NEG	However, even if contamination were to occur, this would bias the results of the trial toward the null, and we observed a positive effect of the intervention despite the potential for contamination.
TEST	POS	PMC5152707.xml	S196		POS	Although we reviewed electronic medical records and attempted to contact all enrolled patients, we were unable to contact 70 (8%) for assessment of a secondary outcome.
TEST	POS	PMC5152707.xml	S197		NEG	Of these, 68 were confirmed alive at 45 days.
TEST	POS	PMC5152707.xml	S198		NEG	The 92% phone follow-up rate supplemented by mortality review from a national database is, however, robust and comparable to other high quality studies of patients in the emergency department setting with potential acute coronary syndrome.
TEST	POS	PMC5152707.xml	S199		POS	We were unable to obtain video recordings in 40% of the encounters.
TEST	POS	PMC5152707.xml	S200		NEG	However, the 536 video recordings that were obtained exceeded the required sample size of 221 needed to meet power estimates.
TEST	POS	PMC5152707.xml	S201		POS	The study had 78% power to detect a 5% difference in MACEs between study arms, using a one sided non-inferiority test with an α of 0.05.
TEST	POS	PMC5152707.xml	S202		POS	Although this was substantially greater power than the initial cohort of patients recruited in our single center pilot trial, greater power and precision would be optimal.
TEST	POS	PMC5152707.xml	S203		NEG	It is critical that evidence based local practice protocols to definitively rule out acute myocardial infarction with serial cardiac troponin tests be reliably followed in all patients, regardless of the decision to undergo further cardiac stress testing during the index emergency department visit or to follow-up as an outpatient.
TEST	POS	PMC5152707.xml	S204		NEG	This is highlighted by the fact that four patients in the decision aid group and one patient in the usual care group were diagnosed as having acute myocardial infarction during their index presentation.
TEST	POS	PMC5152707.xml	S205		NEG	Although no patients in this trial were ruled out for acute myocardial infarction using serial cardiac troponin results, were discharged home from the hospital without further testing, or subsequently experienced an acute myocardial infarction before follow-up as an outpatient, this scenario is possible, and a large scale implementation trial is needed to definitively assess safety.
TEST	NEG	PMC5152707.xml	S220		NEG	While the findings from this multicenter trial suggest that the decision aid might be effective across a variety of clinical settings, further implementation studies are needed to determine how best to incorporate it in care pathways, how emergency clinicians, cardiologists, and primary care clinicians can best work together to ensure incorporation and implementation of informed patient preferences into admission, testing, and follow-up decisions, and how to ensure patient preferences guide decision making both during and after the emergency department encounter.
TEST	NEG	PMC5154975.xml	S26		NEG	Given the complexity of olfactory receptors it is likely that additional genetic variations contribute to the differences in humans’ ability to detect the odor of asparagus metabolites.
TEST	NEG	PMC5154975.xml	S38		NEG	We carried out multivariable logistic regression analyses, modeling single nucleotide polymorphisms as ordinal variables and asparagus anosmia as the outcome.
TEST	NEG	PMC5154975.xml	S39		NEG	Models were adjusted for age, sex, smoking status (never, former, and current), and the first three principal components of genetic variation (to adjust for potential confounding by ethnicity).
TEST	NEG	PMC5154975.xml	S45		NEG	We then used the variant effect predictor tool to determine the effect of the variants on the amino acid sequence.
TEST	NEG	PMC5154976.xml	S16		NEG	A meta-analysis of longitudinal observational studies published before 2008 indicated that greater wellbeing was associated with lower all cause mortality in initially healthy population cohorts (adjusted hazard ratio 0.82, 95% confidence interval 0.76 to 0.89), although there were indications of publication bias.3
TEST	NEG	PMC5154976.xml	S23		NEG	Evidence of time dependent exposure effects would increase confidence in a potential causal association.
TEST	NEG	PMC5154976.xml	S24		NEG	In the present analysis, we tested the notion that repeated reports over several years would have a stronger association with mortality than a single occurrence.
TEST	NEG	PMC5154976.xml	S25		NEG	We used measures of enjoyment of life taken three times at two year intervals between 2002 and 2006, and analysed associations with mortality up to 2013, predicting that a temporal dose-response association would be apparent.
TEST	NEG	PMC5154976.xml	S36		NEG	Enjoyment of life was indexed with four items from the CASP-19 quality of life instrument, as described previously.12 14
TEST	NEG	PMC5154976.xml	S40		NEG	We then generated a variable for enjoyment, defining no enjoyment as scores from 0 to 2, and high enjoyment if scores were 3 or 4 (meaning that the individual reported enjoyment on 3 or 4 of the items).
TEST	NEG	PMC5154976.xml	S42		NEG	Education was based on the highest qualification achieved and categorised into lower (no qualifications), intermediate (qualifications below college degree level), and higher (college degree or higher).
TEST	NEG	PMC5154976.xml	S54		NEG	We generated a sustained enjoyment variable by summing the number of reports of high enjoyment of life between 2002 and 2006; scores could range from none to three reports for each individual.
TEST	NEG	PMC5154976.xml	S57		NEG	Five models were tested in the analyses of all cause mortality.
TEST	NEG	PMC5154976.xml	S58		NEG	Model 1 was adjusted for age (categorised as 50-59, 60-69, 70-79, and ≥80 years) and sex.
TEST	NEG	PMC5154976.xml	S62		NEG	Separate regression analyses were carried out of non-cardiovascular deaths and deaths from cardiovascular disease.
TEST	NEG	PMC5154976.xml	S63		NEG	In addition, we modelled enjoyment of life as a continuous score (0, 1, 2, 3) where the hazard ratios represent (in the last column of each table) a one report increase of enjoyment of life.
TEST	NEG	PMC5154976.xml	S66		NEG	With imputations, all individuals in the initial sample had a measure of enjoyment at all three waves.
TEST	NEG	PMC5154976.xml	S71		NEG	Secondly, we examined all permutations of the timing of enjoyment ratings, to investigate different patterns in the high enjoyment reports (eg, one wave was wave 1 only, or wave 2 only or wave 3 only; two waves were waves 1 and 2, waves 2 and 3, or waves 1 and 3), and included deaths that occurred during the assessment of enjoyment of life (results available on request).
TEST	NEG	PMC5154976.xml	S77		NEG	No patients were asked to advise on interpretation or writing up of results.
TEST	NEG	PMC5154976.xml	S80		NEG	We found that 2264 (24%) participants reported no high levels of enjoyment of life on any occasion, with 1833 (20%) having one, 2063 (22%) having two, and 3205 (34%) having three reports of high enjoyment.
TEST	NEG	PMC5154976.xml	S98		NEG	The second sensitivity analysis explored whether different patterns of enjoyment over time were important in relation to mortality.
TEST	NEG	PMC5154976.xml	S112		NEG	Firstly, it shows that duration of exposure to positive emotional states is important.
TEST	POS	PMC5154976.xml	S119		NEG	We also measured self-rated health and limiting longstanding illness as indicators of less tangible health problems that might confound associations between positive wellbeing and mortality, and assessments of depressive symptoms to account for the presence of negative affective states.
TEST	POS	PMC5154976.xml	S120		NEG	An analysis of the Million Women Study showed no association between a simple four point rating of frequency of happiness and survival, due in large part to a substantial overlap of the happiness ratings with self-rated health.11
TEST	POS	PMC5154976.xml	S121		NEG	The number of reports of enjoyment was also associated with good self-rated health in the present study (table 1).
TEST	POS	PMC5154976.xml	S122		NEG	Nevertheless, our observation that multiple reports of high enjoyment remained independent predictors of mortality when this and other factors had been included in the analytical models increases our confidence that associations are robust.
TEST	POS	PMC5154976.xml	S123		NEG	Thirdly, we have documented associations between sustained wellbeing and death from non-cardiovascular causes as well as all cause mortality.
TEST	POS	PMC5154976.xml	S124		NEG	Previous work has documented links between lower subjective wellbeing and cardiovascular disease incidence and longer survival.4 21 22
TEST	POS	PMC5154976.xml	S125		POS	However, cardiovascular disease accounted for only around a third of deaths in this study, limiting statistical power to detect associations.
TEST	POS	PMC5154976.xml	S126		NEG	The findings for deaths from non-cardiovascular causes suggest that subjective wellbeing has a more general association with survival.
TEST	POS	PMC5154976.xml	S127		POS	This was an observational study, so we are not able to interpret the associations between enjoyment of life and survival as causal.
TEST	POS	PMC5154976.xml	S128		POS	Although we controlled for a wide range of potential confounders, other unmeasured factors could be important.
TEST	POS	PMC5154976.xml	S129		POS	Our assessment of initial health was not complete, even though we included general measures such as self-rated health as well as serious diagnosed conditions.
TEST	POS	PMC5154976.xml	S130		POS	A substantial proportion of participants in ELSA did not complete all three assessments of enjoyment of life, either because they died during the four year measurement period or because they dropped out of the study temporarily or permanently.
TEST	POS	PMC5154976.xml	S131		NEG	However, analyses of participants who completed all assessments showed results comparable to the multiply imputed datasets, indicating that attrition during the measurement period does not explain our findings.
TEST	POS	PMC5154976.xml	S132		NEG	Subjective wellbeing has many facets, including hedonic wellbeing (feelings of happiness and joy), evaluative wellbeing (life satisfaction), and eudemonic wellbeing (judgments about meaning and purpose in life).23
TEST	POS	PMC5154976.xml	S133		NEG	Our measure of enjoyment of life includes components of hedonic wellbeing, social engagement, and vitality, all of which might be important for sustained health.22
TEST	POS	PMC5154976.xml	S134		POS	A limitation of this analysis was that we only assessed enjoyment of life every two years, and do not know whether it fluctuated between measurement points.18
TEST	POS	PMC5154976.xml	S135		POS	We also do not know about the pattern of enjoyment of participants’ lives before they enrolled in the study.

TEST	NEG	PMC5159977.xml	S92	Methods	NEG	Sensitivity analyses were performed to assess the robustness of these initial clusters in ADEPT (removing the medoid subjects and whole study arms), the longitudinal stability of the clusters, and the homologous clusters observed when clustering on U-BIOPRED subjects, overcome the limitations of not employing permutations.
TEST	NEG	PMC5159977.xml	S112	Methods	NEG	Endobronchial biopsies and epithelial brushings, taken at bifurcations of sub-segmental airways in the lower lobes, were immediately preserved in RNAlater® solution and then maintained at −70 °C [10, 11].
TEST	NEG	PMC5159977.xml	S184	Results	NEG	The Pearson’s Contingency Coefficients representing the within-subject consistency of classified phenotype across visits were 0.81, 0.74, 0.76, and 0.78 for actual baseline phenotypes A1, A2, A3, and A4, respectively.
TEST	NEG	PMC5159977.xml	S215	Results	NEG	Phenotype US4 was homologous to Phenotype A4.
TEST	NEG	PMC5159977.xml	S222	Results	NEG	All 4 clusters had significantly higher SNOT scores (p < 7x10−5), particularly for clusters US3 and US4.
TEST	NEG	PMC5159977.xml	S250	Discussion	NEG	Phenotype A1, was remarkably similar to Phenotype US1 from the U-BIOPRED validation set.
TEST	NEG	PMC5159977.xml	S293	Discussion	NEG	We have observed that the T2-high phenotype is a subset of a broader eosinophilic phenotype group in ADEPT and U-BIOPRED studies [27], consistent with results from Choy et al. [28] in mild asthma (evaluating T2 phenotype status by POSTN, SERPINB2, and CLCA1 expression in endobronchial brushings).
TEST	POS	PMC5159977.xml	S295	Discussion	NEG	Phenotypes A1, A2, and A4 are then clinically distinguished by degree of asthma control and airflow limitations.
TEST	POS	PMC5159977.xml	S296	Discussion	POS	Ideally T2 and eosinophilic inflammation would be established from airway mucosal and sputum sampling, but these are difficult to evaluate in a standard clinical setting.
TEST	POS	PMC5159977.xml	S297	Discussion	POS	Blood eosinophils, FENO, and potentially serum proteins could serve as surrogates to establish these phenotypes, but alone are insufficient to define such.
TEST	POS	PMC5159977.xml	S298	Discussion	NEG	Combinations of the surrogates, as utilized in the classification of the phenotype groups, are needed for more accurate estimation of T2 and eosinophilic phenotypes.
TEST	NEG	PMC5159977.xml	S301	Discussion	NEG	Post-hoc perturbation analyses (not reported) assessing the impact of adding in additional demographic, historical, and treatment attributes (e.g., gender, age, atopy, asthma age-of-onset, BMI, ICS dose; 20 variables total), resulted in weaker clustering (based on distance metrics and cluster membership probabilities), with qualitatively similar clinical associations as reported for the ADEPT asthma phenotypes (65% concordance of the most closely analogous clusters with the reported ADEPT asthma phenotypes).
TEST	NEG	PMC5159977.xml	S305	Discussion	NEG	Compliance was not formally monitored in these studies.
TEST	POS	PMC5159977.xml	S310	Discussion	NEG	Nevertheless, there are also limitations.
TEST	POS	PMC5159977.xml	S311	Discussion	POS	The actual prevalence of the clinical clusters cannot be directly estimated because participants were not randomly recruited from the general asthma population.
TEST	POS	PMC5159977.xml	S312	Discussion	NEG	ADEPT had strict inclusion/exclusion criteria to restrict enrollment to patients likely to be enrolled in interventional clinical studies.
TEST	POS	PMC5159977.xml	S313	Discussion	POS	Thus morbidly obese participants, smoking participants and chronic OCS-treated participants are not represented in ADEPT.
TEST	POS	PMC5159977.xml	S314	Discussion	NEG	In contrast, U-BIOPRED did include smokers and chronic OCS treated patients, with almost 50% of asthmatics on chronic OCS therapy.
TEST	POS	PMC5159977.xml	S315	Discussion	NEG	These features in fact predominated in the distinction of the 4 clinical clusters that have been reported with the U-BIOPRED cohort [29] (Additional file 1: Section S12).
TEST	POS	PMC5159977.xml	S316	Discussion	NEG	Indeed, 4 clusters were identified, of which the first consisted of well-controlled mild-to-moderate asthmatics, while the 3 other clusters consisting of predominantly severe asthma patients were characterised by 2 clusters of chronic airflow obstruction, one with late-onset asthma in predominant smokers/ex-smokers with high BMI and the other in non-smokers with high OCS use; the fourth cluster consisted of predominantly obese female patients with uncontrolled asthma and increased exacerbations, but with normal lung function [29].

TEST	NEG	PMC5162097.xml	S20	Background	NEG	As expected, COPD and the catastrophic complications of advanced stage disease impose a substantial economic burden on healthcare systems; in the US alone, direct costs of COPD have been estimated at $29.5 billion, with indirect costs of $20.4 billion [8].
TEST	NEG	PMC5162097.xml	S94	Results	NEG	Nonetheless, a significant reduction in conventional cigarette consumption was also observed in dual users, with their mean (±SD) cigarettes/day use decreasing from 23.7 (±5.4) at baseline to 4 (±1.2) at F/up1 and to 3.5 (±1.3) at F/up2, respectively (p < 0.001 for both visits) (Table 3).
TEST	NEG	PMC5162097.xml	S131	Discussion	NEG	By contrast, in the Lung Health Study [40] and in a 2.5-years follow up of 64 COPD patients by Kessler et al. [41] there was no significant difference in the risk of hospital admission between current smokers and ex-smokers.

TEST	NEG	PMC5176330.xml	S38	Methods	NEG	Cardiac troponin I concentrations in stored plasma were determined at baseline and at 1 year using the ARCHITECTSTAT high-sensitive troponin I assay (Abbott Laboratories, Abbott Park, Illinois).
TEST	NEG	PMC5176330.xml	S40	Methods	NEG	The upper reference limit or 99th-centile value is 34 ng/l in men (16).
TEST	NEG	PMC5176330.xml	S66	Results	NEG	For the purpose of this analysis, 7 participants with undetectable troponin concentrations were assigned a value of 1.2 ng/l.
TEST	NEG	PMC5176330.xml	S84	Results	NEG	The absolute change in troponin concentration from baseline with pravastatin was 2.0 ng/l (interquartile range: 1.2 to 2.8 ng/l; p < 0.001).
TEST	NEG	PMC5176330.xml	S96	Results	NEG	lowest quarter: >3% increase) had the largest reduction in cardiovascular events (HR: 0.21.
TEST	POS	PMC5176330.xml	S143	Discussion	POS	The trial was conducted in middle-aged men with raised cholesterol levels, and the findings may not be applicable to the wider population including women.
TEST	POS	PMC5176330.xml	S144	Discussion	POS	This is an important point, as the threshold of 5.2 ng/l that identified men at increased risk in our study population may not apply to women or to other groups (16).
TEST	POS	PMC5176330.xml	S145	Discussion	POS	We were able to obtain results from only 3,318 participants, and the requirement for a 1-year sample restricted the study population to those who were compliant with the protocol.
TEST	POS	PMC5176330.xml	S146	Discussion	NEG	This is the most likely explanation for the apparently greater treatment effect in this study compared to the intention-to-treat risk reduction reported previously (8).
TEST	POS	PMC5176330.xml	S147	Discussion	POS	Our analysis was performed on samples stored for 20 years, and it is possible we underestimated the association between troponin and coronary heart disease events because of interference from the formation of fibrin microparticulates during storage.
TEST	POS	PMC5176330.xml	S148	Discussion	NEG	Although the effect of pravastatin on troponin concentrations was highly consistent across the study population, the absolute and relative reductions were modest at 2 ng/l and 19%, respectively.
TEST	POS	PMC5176330.xml	S149	Discussion	POS	Although assay precision is very good at concentrations below our median concentration of 4.1 ng/l (∼10% coefficient of variation) (25) and even smaller changes in cardiac troponin concentration were strongly associated with coronary heart disease events across the study population, we acknowledge it will be more challenging to monitor changes accurately in individual patients.
TEST	POS	PMC5176330.xml	S150	Discussion	POS	Changes in troponin concentration of 2 ng/l after initiation of statin therapy may be masked by other aspects of biological or analytical variability (26).
TEST	POS	PMC5176330.xml	S151	Discussion	NEG	However, there are methodological approaches to reduce the former, for example, performing duplicate measurements 2 weeks apart, and novel technologies that enhance assay precision through single molecular counting that will minimize the latter (27).
TEST	POS	PMC5176330.xml	S152	Discussion	NEG	Before this approach can be applied in clinical practice, prospective studies are needed to determine whether we can consistently quantify small changes in cardiac troponin I concentration in response to treatment in individuals.
TEST	NEG	PMC5176330.xml	S154	Conclusions	NEG	Cardiac troponin I is an independent predictor of coronary heart disease events in middle-aged hypercholesterolemic men without prior myocardial infarction.
TEST	NEG	PMC5176330.xml	S156	Conclusions	NEG	These findings suggest that high-sensitivity cardiac troponin has major potential to identify those at greatest risk and to assess their response to interventions for the prevention of coronary heart disease.
TEST	NEG	PMC5179309.xml	S8	Purpose	NEG	A partial human skull was positioned over the animal’s brain.
TEST	NEG	PMC5179309.xml	S14	Purpose	NEG	A cavitation safety algorithm was developed based on logistic regression of the measurements and tested to minimize risks of hemorrhage.
TEST	NEG	PMC5179316.xml	S12	Objectives	NEG	This study suggests that TNF-α inhibitors may have a comparable rate of serious infections to the range of those observed in registry databases when used in patients with HIV infection under active care.
TEST	NEG	PMC5181129.xml	S14	Objective:	NEG	Hernia recurrence rate was 17% (n = 16).
TEST	NEG	PMC5181129.xml	S17	Objective:	NEG	Mean 24-month EQ-5D (index and visual analogue) and SF-12 physical component and mental scores improved from baseline (P < 0.05).
TEST	NEG	PMC5181129.xml	S52	METHODS	NEG	An anterior component separation was performed when external oblique muscles were released.
TEST	NEG	PMC5181129.xml	S58	METHODS	NEG	Antibiotics were continued for the first 24 hours according to Surgical Care Improvement Project (SCIP) protocols.
TEST	NEG	PMC5181129.xml	S64	METHODS	NEG	For analysis purposes, if the prosthetic material came in contact with a stoma site in patients with a concomitant stoma with or without a parastomal hernia component, it was considered part of the primary repair.
TEST	NEG	PMC5181129.xml	S67	METHODS	NEG	Wound events were classified as surgical site infections based on CDC criteria into superficial, deep, or organ space.12
TEST	NEG	PMC5181129.xml	S70	METHODS	NEG	If surgical debridement was required, prosthetic management was defined as: no intervention, partial resection, or full removal of the biosynthetic mesh.
TEST	NEG	PMC5181129.xml	S79	METHODS	NEG	Patients completed the questionnaire based on how good or bad their health was for that day of administration relative to their ventral hernia repair from which a single-digit score described the patients’ health state.
TEST	NEG	PMC5181129.xml	S92	METHODS	NEG	Statistical differences for the SF-12 and EQ-5D over time were evaluated using paired t tests, using P < 0.05 as the cut-off for statistical significance.
TEST	NEG	PMC5181129.xml	S94	METHODS	NEG	Statistical analysis was done using SAS Software (Cary, NC), version 9.2.
TEST	NEG	PMC5181129.xml	S121	RESULTS	NEG	When estimating only midline hernia recurrence, the Kaplan-Meier recurrence rate at 24 months was 14%.
TEST	NEG	PMC5181129.xml	S122	RESULTS	NEG	The recurrence rate was higher in patients with mesh placement in the intraperitoneal position (40%; 4/10) versus those with placement in the retrorectus position (13% [12/94]; P = 0.0451).
TEST	NEG	PMC5181129.xml	S124	RESULTS	NEG	Time to hernia recurrence was shorter for patients with postoperative infection than those patients without (P = 0.0098) (Supplemental Digital Content Fig. 2) and with parastomal compared with midline hernia recurrences (P < 0.0001) (Supplemental Digital Content Fig. 3).
TEST	NEG	PMC5181129.xml	S132	RESULTS	NEG	No cases required complete explantation of the biosynthetic mesh.
TEST	NEG	PMC5181129.xml	S133	RESULTS	NEG	All wounds were completely healed at long-term follow-up.
TEST	NEG	PMC5181129.xml	S149	DISCUSSION	NEG	Overall, hernia recurrence occurred in 16 patients with a Kaplan-Meier recurrence rate of 17% at 24 months.
TEST	NEG	PMC5181129.xml	S151	DISCUSSION	NEG	In fact, the Repair of Infected and Contaminated Hernias (RICH) trial is the only long-term, multicentered, prospective trial to evaluate biologic mesh in CDC class II to IV wounds.9
TEST	NEG	PMC5181129.xml	S181	DISCUSSION	NEG	As such, the surgical community is reluctant to do so until high-level clinical outcomes data are available.
TEST	POS	PMC5181129.xml	S182	DISCUSSION	NEG	Furthermore, large-pore, reduced-weight mesh does have its limitations.
TEST	POS	PMC5181129.xml	S183	DISCUSSION	NEG	Petro et al25 described 7 patients with central mesh failure after ventral hernia repair with lightweight monofilament polyester mesh placed in the retrorectus position with complete posterior and anterior fascial coverage.
TEST	POS	PMC5181129.xml	S184	DISCUSSION	NEG	In clean or CDC class I wounds, a prospective randomized trial demonstrated a trend (P = 0.052) toward an increased recurrence rate for large-pore, lightweight mesh (17%) compared with “standard” mesh (7%) for retrorectus ventral hernia repairs.26
TEST	NEG	PMC5181129.xml	S188	DISCUSSION	NEG	The absorption profile of the synthetic mesh, degradation versus time, may alter “constructive remodeling,” but comparative biomechanical data are not available.
TEST	NEG	PMC5181129.xml	S191	DISCUSSION	NEG	As a result, a greater focus has been made on assessing quality of life surrounding surgical procedures.
TEST	NEG	PMC5181129.xml	S192	DISCUSSION	NEG	Some groups have gathered significant data and have successfully generated quality-of-life assessment tools specific to a surgical procedure or a disease process.
TEST	NEG	PMC5181129.xml	S196	DISCUSSION	NEG	Not surprisingly, assessment of physical health at 1 month after surgery showed an initial drop as patients still contended with postoperative discomfort.
TEST	NEG	PMC5181129.xml	S197	DISCUSSION	NEG	However, the results seen in the SF-12 mental health domain suggested a more complex impact of hernia repair on these patients.
TEST	NEG	PMC5181129.xml	S203	DISCUSSION	NEG	The definition of a successful outcome is not clear.
TEST	POS	PMC5181129.xml	S207	DISCUSSION	NEG	This study is not without limitations.
TEST	POS	PMC5181129.xml	S208	DISCUSSION	POS	First, the selected study format of a longitudinal observation of a patient cohort potentially limits the ability to apply these results.
TEST	POS	PMC5181129.xml	S209	DISCUSSION	POS	Lack of a control group or any element of randomization does introduce an opportunity to suggest that alternative mesh options, including a biologic product, could provide a similar outcome.
TEST	POS	PMC5181129.xml	S210	DISCUSSION	POS	Second, the duration of follow-up of 24 months is a commonly selected time point, but it is well understood that the longer hernia repair patients are followed, the greater the rate of recurrence.
TEST	POS	PMC5181129.xml	S211	DISCUSSION	POS	However, the product used in this study undergoes hydrolysis, as it is replaced with vascularized soft tissue.
TEST	POS	PMC5181129.xml	S212	DISCUSSION	NEG	This process is generally considered to have completed by 6 to 7 months.
TEST	POS	PMC5181129.xml	S213	DISCUSSION	NEG	Therefore, the 24-month window seems to provide a more than adequate time period for recurrence to develop.
TEST	POS	PMC5181129.xml	S214	DISCUSSION	POS	Third, the diversity of hernia size may represent a challenge to draw conclusions.
TEST	POS	PMC5181129.xml	S215	DISCUSSION	POS	Inclusion criteria allowed hernias as small as 9 cm2.
TEST	POS	PMC5181129.xml	S216	DISCUSSION	NEG	However, the mean defect size was 137 cm2, with a range from 10 to 513 cm2.
TEST	POS	PMC5181129.xml	S217	DISCUSSION	NEG	So, the majority of hernias were well in excess of this minimum.
TEST	POS	PMC5181129.xml	S218	DISCUSSION	POS	Fourth, the clinical characteristics of patients varied within the study group, with several patients undergoing straightforward, clean-contaminated cases simultaneous to hernia repair, whereas others underwent contaminated cases that addressed infected mesh removal.
TEST	POS	PMC5181129.xml	S219	DISCUSSION	POS	Arguably, this could have also been approached with separated cohorts.
TEST	POS	PMC5181129.xml	S220	DISCUSSION	POS	Fifth, there are still inherent limitations of outcomes research (eg, quality-of-life indices) in patients with complex ventral hernia repair.
TEST	POS	PMC5181129.xml	S221	DISCUSSION	POS	The definition of a successful outcome is not as clear as would be desired.
TEST	POS	PMC5181129.xml	S222	DISCUSSION	POS	Sixth, physical examination, although an appropriate standard for assessment, is not as accurate as a computerized tomogram (CT).
TEST	POS	PMC5181129.xml	S223	DISCUSSION	NEG	Routine postoperative CT examination of the abdominal wall would have been more accurate.
TEST	POS	PMC5181129.xml	S224	DISCUSSION	NEG	However, this approach to hernia assessment has proven controversial as well.
TEST	POS	PMC5181129.xml	S225	DISCUSSION	NEG	In some studies, the CT findings were not associated with sign or symptoms of a hernia.
TEST	POS	PMC5181129.xml	S226	DISCUSSION	POS	The clinical relevance of this scenario is not clear and in fact raises more questions than not.
TEST	POS	PMC5181129.xml	S227	DISCUSSION	NEG	Therefore, relying on clinical evaluation with questioning and physical examination is more appropriate.
TEST	POS	PMC5181129.xml	S228	DISCUSSION	POS	Finally, the generalizability of any multicenter prospective trial or for that matter randomized controlled trial is always subject to real-time data and experience.

TEST	NEG	PMC5181647.xml	S116		NEG	Coronary CTA has also documented the adverse prognosis associated with nonobstructive disease (not detected with standard perfusion assessments) and confirmed the excellent prognosis for patients with a normal coronary CTA, with a risk of cardiovascular events of <0.5% that extends up to 5 years (50).
TEST	NEG	PMC5181647.xml	S142		NEG	Nevertheless, CMR angiography allows assessment of the proximal and midcoronary vessels with an accuracy approaching that of CTA (26).
TEST	NEG	PMC5181647.xml	S225		NEG	T2-weighted short-tau inversion recovery (STIR) imaging detects regions of myocardial edema, helping to differentiate acute from chronic infarction and to allow calculation of the myocardial area at risk (95).

TEST	NEG	PMC5181797.xml	S15		NEG	Approximately 15% of colorectal cancer (CRC) patients would present with metastatic disease at diagnosis, and a further 40% to 50% would continuously develop metastases through the course of disease.[1,2]
TEST	NEG	PMC5181797.xml	S138		NEG	While neither antibody demonstrated a clearly superior outcome in the present analysis, the OS curves split after 2.5 years, about 1.5 years after disease progression on first-line therapy, thereafter appearing to favor the cetuximab combination (Fig. 2B).
TEST	NEG	PMC5181797.xml	S151		POS	However, it should be noted that KRAS wild-type patients were limited in the bevacizumab group (n = 63).
TEST	NEG	PMC5181797.xml	S156		NEG	It causes the terminal stage of colorectal cancer; diminishes quality of life by ascites retention, malnutrition, and intestinal obstruction; and is associated with a poor prognosis.[49,50]

TEST	NEG	PMC5181799.xml	S27	Case report	NEG	Arterial blood gas analysis revealed pH 7.42, PaO2 51 mm Hg, PaCO2 28 mm Hg.
TEST	NEG	PMC5181799.xml	S77	Results	NEG	The incidence of myocarditis in CSS patients 20 to 30 years old (22.7%) was higher than that for other groups.
TEST	NEG	PMC5181799.xml	S152	Discussion	NEG	We conclude that (1) the younger age of CSS, the greater occurrence rate of complicating myocarditis and the poorer prognosis; (2) female CSS patients are older than male patients; (3) patients with cardiac involvement usually have a history of severe asthma; (4) markedly increased eosinophil count suggests a potential diagnosis of CSS (when the count increases to 20% of white blood cell counts or 8.1×109/L, eosinophils start to infiltrate into myocardium); and (5) negative ANCA status is associated with heart disease in CSS.
TEST	NEG	PMC5181800.xml	S24	Introduction	NEG	However, unfortunately this treatment could not abolish the pain.
TEST	NEG	PMC5181800.xml	S26	Introduction	NEG	Therefore, propofol long-chain triglycerides (LCT)/medium-chain triglycerides (MCT) was introduced in attempts to prevent injection pain by reducing the concentration of aqueous-free propofol.[7]
TEST	NEG	PMC5181800.xml	S28	Introduction	NEG	It was demonstrated that pretreatment with lidocaine with venous retention before injection of propofol LCT or lidocaine premixed in propofol LCT were more effective in reducing pain than a more expensive reformulation of propofol-LCT/MCT.[8,9]
TEST	NEG	PMC5181800.xml	S34	Introduction	NEG	Therefore, we evaluated the effect of pretreatment with oral pregabalin 75 and 150 mg on pain from propofol injection, compared with intravenous lidocaine 40 mg with venous occlusion.
TEST	NEG	PMC5181800.xml	S68	Methods	NEG	Statistical significance was accepted at P < 0.05.
TEST	NEG	PMC5181800.xml	S73	Results	NEG	The overall incidence of propofol injection pain was significantly decreased in group L (55%) and group HP (50%), compared with group LP (92.5%) (P < 0.05, respectively).
TEST	NEG	PMC5181800.xml	S95	Discussion	NEG	The fundamental mechanism of action of pregabalin is the reduction of release of calcium by binding to α2-δ subunit of calcium channels, which inhibit excitatory neurotransmitter including glutamate and increase neuronal GABA levels.[18]
TEST	NEG	PMC5181800.xml	S102	Discussion	NEG	In the present study, pretreatment with 150 mg pregabalin was effective in reducing propofol injection pain, which was comparable with pretreatment with lidocaine 40 mg with venous retention.
TEST	POS	PMC5181800.xml	S104	Discussion	NEG	The present study had some limitations.
TEST	POS	PMC5181800.xml	S105	Discussion	POS	First, placebo group was not examined to determine the baseline incidence of pain following propofol injection.
TEST	POS	PMC5181800.xml	S106	Discussion	NEG	Pain during propofol injection is a common clinical problem.[3,5,6]
TEST	POS	PMC5181800.xml	S107	Discussion	NEG	Therefore, in this study, it was considered unethical that patients given propofol did not receive prophylactic analgesics.
TEST	POS	PMC5181800.xml	S108	Discussion	POS	Second, in this study, premedication was not administered, which could affect pain on injection of propofol.
TEST	POS	PMC5181800.xml	S109	Discussion	NEG	The incidence of postoperative recall of this pain was about 50% to 87% if sedative or anxiolytic premedication was not given.[8,28]
TEST	POS	PMC5181800.xml	S110	Discussion	NEG	The recall of pain during injection of propofol can decrease patient's satisfaction with anesthetic care.[8]
TEST	POS	PMC5181800.xml	S111	Discussion	POS	Therefore, another study will be required to investigate the postoperative recall for this pain.

TEST	NEG	PMC5181803.xml	S83	Results	NEG	Cytometry analysis showed that there were similar proportions of G1 cells in MSCs transfusion and control mice (64.24% vs 69.98%; Table 2), whereas irradiated mice had significantly more G1 cells than the other 2 groups (90.53% vs 64.24% and 69.98%).
TEST	NEG	PMC5181803.xml	S84	Results	NEG	There were less cells arrested in S phase in the radiation group compared with that in the control group (5.77% vs 22.62%), but the difference disappeared after MSCs transfusion (21.43%; Table 2).
TEST	NEG	PMC5181803.xml	S92	Results	NEG	When looked at CD4+/CD8− T cells, less numbers of cells were arrested at S phase in radiation group than in control group, and the number increased insignificantly after MSCs transfusion (Table 3).
TEST	NEG	PMC5181804.xml	S175	Abstract	NEG	Esophageal involvement, T grade, and CA125 were risk factors of curability.
TEST	NEG	PMC5181804.xml	S177	Abstract	NEG	T grade and CA125 were risk factors of N status.
TEST	NEG	PMC5181804.xml	S92	Results	NEG	Of all clinicopathological factors, age, gastric body, gastric antrum, esophageal involvement, T grade, and grading of cancer were associated with curability (Table 1).
TEST	NEG	PMC5181804.xml	S158	Discussion	NEG	Another literature reports that the level of CA125 appears to correlate with disease activity, disease-free and overall survival in patients of non-Hodgkin lymphoma.[35]
TEST	POS	PMC5181804.xml	S163	Discussion	NEG	However, there were still some limitations.
TEST	POS	PMC5181804.xml	S164	Discussion	POS	As this was a retrospective study, the definition of Borrmann type and grading was not strictly unified, so there may be systematic bias.
TEST	POS	PMC5181804.xml	S165	Discussion	POS	Besides, the information was incomplete in some patients, which affected the credibility of our study.
TEST	POS	PMC5181804.xml	S166	Discussion	POS	The number of cases of distant metastasis was limited and relevant results need a larger number of cases to verify.
TEST	NEG	PMC5181806.xml	S25	Introduction	NEG	However, syndesmosis injuries occasionally contribute to chronic instability and tendon injury.[2]
TEST	NEG	PMC5181806.xml	S69	Discussion	NEG	The etiology of PTTD is likely to be multifactorial because both extrinsic such as ankle surgery and intrinsic risk factors have been reported.[9]
TEST	NEG	PMC5181806.xml	S90	Discussion	NEG	A detailed explanation of PDRN was provided to the patient who consented to the treatment strategy.
TEST	NEG	PMC5181806.xml	S106	Discussion	NEG	This case indicated that PDRN could positively modify PTTD after ankle syndesmotic injury.
TEST	NEG	PMC5181807.xml	S18	Introduction	NEG	During the past 6 decades, lifestyle and eating patterns have been dramatically changes, associated with socioeconomic development,[3] which may affect atherosclerosis development.[4,5]
TEST	NEG	PMC5181807.xml	S25	Introduction	NEG	However, no study has focused on the effects of dose-dependency of current smoking, including smoking cessation, on arterial stiffness using AI in a general population.
TEST	NEG	PMC5181807.xml	S40	Subjects and methods	NEG	The nonsmokers were defined as no past or current history of smoking, the former smokers as smoking cessation before the examination, and the current smokers as smoking at least 1 cigarette a day.
TEST	NEG	PMC5181807.xml	S42	Subjects and methods	NEG	BP was measured in the supine position twice at 3-minute intervals using an upright standard sphygmomanometer.
TEST	NEG	PMC5181807.xml	S65	Subjects and methods	NEG	Multiple stepwise regression analysis was performed for independent associated factors of AI (Tables 6 and 7).
TEST	NEG	PMC5181807.xml	S78	Results	NEG	Systolic (P < 0.001) and diastolic (P < 0.001) BPs, HDL-cholesterol (P = 0.048), FPG (P = 0.023; inversely), smoking habits (P = 0.035).
TEST	NEG	PMC5181807.xml	S81	Results	NEG	AI levels in females were significantly and independently associated with age (P < 0.001), systolic BP (P < 0.001), FPG (inversely; P = 0.011), and smoking habits (P = 0.027).
TEST	NEG	PMC5181807.xml	S92	Discussion	NEG	The correlation between AI levels and BMI has been inconsistent.
TEST	NEG	PMC5181807.xml	S99	Discussion	NEG	Recently, smoking in men has been more common in Asia than in the United Kingdom and United State of America, which is opposite in women.[26]
TEST	POS	PMC5181807.xml	S114	Discussion	NEG	There are several limitations in our study.
TEST	POS	PMC5181807.xml	S115	Discussion	POS	First, the study design was a cross-sectional.
TEST	POS	PMC5181807.xml	S116	Discussion	POS	Thus, nothing conclusive for the association of AI and smoking habits can be stated.
TEST	POS	PMC5181807.xml	S117	Discussion	POS	Prospective studies are needed to investigate the role of AI in smokers, especially in the aspects of mortality or cardiovascular events.
TEST	POS	PMC5181807.xml	S118	Discussion	POS	Second, from the multiple correlation coefficients, the significant 6 factors (as shown in Table 6) explained only 5.0% of the variation of AI.
TEST	POS	PMC5181807.xml	S119	Discussion	POS	Third, we obtained the number of cigarettes by questionnaires, which might not be quantitatively accurate.
TEST	POS	PMC5181807.xml	S120	Discussion	POS	Moreover, we do not have the detailed data regarding smoking duration.
TEST	POS	PMC5181807.xml	S121	Discussion	POS	Forth, because the survey conducted in 2009, the data are little old.
TEST	POS	PMC5181807.xml	S122	Discussion	POS	Finally, although medications for hypertension, dyslipidemia, and diabetes were not correlated with AI levels in our analyses, we were not able to exclude the contributions of some therapeutic agents.
TEST	NEG	PMC5181808.xml	S11	Abstract	NEG	NAR was not associated with HCC recurrence or liver-related mortality in multivariate analysis.
TEST	NEG	PMC5181808.xml	S48	Materials and methods	NEG	Each surgeon was responsible for deciding between AR and NAR, but limited NAR was generally preferred for small and solitary HCC that was peripherally located or exhibited exophytic growth.
TEST	NEG	PMC5181808.xml	S57	Materials and methods	NEG	Tumor recurrence and survival data were also recorded.[11]
TEST	NEG	PMC5181808.xml	S114	Discussion	NEG	Here, we evaluated the effect of AR for a solitary HCC <5 cm that was limited to a specific tumor location (segments 6 and 7).
TEST	NEG	PMC5181808.xml	S130	Discussion	NEG	Among the patients with intrahepatic recurrence, 22 out of the 43 (51.2%) patients in the NAR group experienced recurrence in the right liver lobe, whereas none of the patients in the AR group did.
TEST	NEG	PMC5181808.xml	S133	Discussion	NEG	We consider the risk of recurrence by local dissemination to be negligible, since most HCC recurrences that develop after curative resection are multicentric.
TEST	POS	PMC5181808.xml	S147	Discussion	NEG	This study did have several limitations.
TEST	POS	PMC5181808.xml	S148	Discussion	POS	First, the data were obtained from a single-center.
TEST	POS	PMC5181808.xml	S149	Discussion	POS	Second, the retrospective design of the study implies that patient population could potentially be biased.
TEST	POS	PMC5181808.xml	S150	Discussion	POS	Third, the sample sizes for the 2 groups were not well-balanced for survival analyses.
TEST	POS	PMC5181808.xml	S151	Discussion	POS	These size limitations may have masked differences in clinical outcomes between the 2 groups.
TEST	POS	PMC5181808.xml	S152	Discussion	POS	Therefore, a sufficiently powered prospective study is required to confirm that NAR result in similar postoperative survival and recurrence rates as AR.
TEST	NEG	PMC5181809.xml	S37		NEG	Pneumoperitoneum was maintained using an air pump (UCR Olympus) and by insufflating carbon dioxide through the air/water channel of the endoscope.

TEST	NEG	PMC5181809.xml	S71		NEG	With experience, time taken to locate the cyst was reduced from 22 minutes in the first patient to 5 minutes in the last patient (Table 1).
TEST	NEG	PMC5181809.xml	S81		NEG	The most significant problem with the transgastric route is to locate and expose the liver cyst.
TEST	NEG	PMC5181810.xml	S18		NEG	Clinical examination[8,9] showed that LAARs can significantly prolong prothrombin time (PT) and activated partial thromboplastin time (APTT).
TEST	NEG	PMC5181810.xml	S19		NEG	The treatment for anticoagulant rodenticide poisoning[5] primarily includes administration of vitamin K1, fresh frozen plasma (FFP), prothrombin complex, and recombinant coagulation factor VIIa.
TEST	NEG	PMC5181810.xml	S24		NEG	Because LAARs are highly lipid soluble,[13] the measured half-life of rodenticides in vivo tends to be extremely long,[14,15] with an average treatment time of approximately 168 days.[7]
TEST	NEG	PMC5181810.xml	S31		NEG	Ultimately, 24 cases were included (9 female and 15 male), with an average age of 40.42 ± 19.19 years as shown in Fig. 1.
TEST	NEG	PMC5181810.xml	S37		NEG	A maintenance treatment was then initiated, and the type of anticoagulant rodenticide was determined.
TEST	NEG	PMC5181810.xml	S44		NEG	For binary outcomes, we conducted a nonparametric Wilcoxon rank test.
TEST	NEG	PMC5181810.xml	S45		NEG	Based on the above results, a robust multifactor regression analysis was continuously performed on the selected independent variables (P < 0.05).
TEST	NEG	PMC5181810.xml	S51		NEG	Table 1 shows baseline characteristics of patients, and Table 2 shows toxicant concentration, hemostasis, coagulation indices, and dosage of vitamin K1 (all of which correspond to the time when blood and urine samples were taken), as well as the patients’ VKSTT (the time from the first day after vitamin K1 was administered until the time of toxicant detection in blood and urine) and prehospital time (the exact time of poisoning or 3 days before the onset of first symptoms[17]).
TEST	NEG	PMC5181810.xml	S57		NEG	Correlations between vitamin K1 and variables such as age, brodifacoum exposure, bromadiolone exposure, VKSTT, and prehospital time were analyzed by the Spearman rank correlation test.
TEST	NEG	PMC5181810.xml	S84		NEG	Consequently, the results of those case studies provide little information for establishing guidelines, with the primary outcome being a threshold value of 10 ng/mL brodifacoum; once the concentration of brodifacoum reached less than the 10 ng/mL threshold, vitamin K1 treatment could be stopped.
TEST	POS	PMC5181810.xml	S98		NEG	This study has certain limitations.
TEST	POS	PMC5181810.xml	S99		POS	Genetic differences among patients were not considered in these analyses.
TEST	POS	PMC5181810.xml	S100		POS	Specifically, differences in suppression of the CYP2C9 and VKORC1 genes[26] may have resulted in a weakening of LAAR metabolism and an increase in the toxic effects, contributing to an increased risk of bleeding and coagulation.
TEST	POS	PMC5181810.xml	S101		POS	Further, the therapeutic dose of vitamin K1 was limited to 10 to 120 mg/d (intravenous dose q.d.), and the lowest concentration of monotherapy for brodifacoum was 5 ng/mL.
TEST	POS	PMC5181810.xml	S102		NEG	There is no further research available on higher or lower therapeutic doses.
TEST	POS	PMC5181810.xml	S103		POS	Finally, only some clinical phenomena were explained, and the therapeutic strategies were investigated by a multifactor regression analysis in this study; therefore, the mechanisms behind these phenomena remain unclear.
TEST	POS	PMC5181810.xml	S104		POS	These results were interpreted based on inferences through published reports, clinical experience, and regression analysis of the data.
TEST	POS	PMC5181810.xml	S105		POS	The results of this study may be attributable to a lack of competitive inhibition between the LAARs and vitamin K1.
TEST	POS	PMC5181810.xml	S106		NEG	After successive administration, the distribution of vitamin K1 reached a steady state, and only a small amount of vitamin K1 was required for maintenance treatment.
TEST	POS	PMC5181810.xml	S107		POS	However, successive administrations greater than the minimum dosage resulted in interference (Gunja et al[18] and this study).

TEST	NEG	PMC5181812.xml	S52	Case	NEG	Warfarin was prescribed at 3 mg/d, and anticoagulation therapy with enoxaparin was coadministered at 6000 U/d after ruling out the presence of a deep hematoma and active hemorrhage.
TEST	NEG	PMC5181812.xml	S71	Case	NEG	However, considering the complexities of this case and risks of reoperation, our patient decided not to undergo cardiac surgery but to instead continue with anticoagulant therapy comprising low-molecular-weight heparin and warfarin with a goal INR of 2.5.
TEST	NEG	PMC5181813.xml	S5	Abstract	NEG	A total of 21,745 asymptomatic individuals who underwent abdominal computed tomography (CT) as a health screening examination were enrolled between 2003 and 2013 at the Seoul National University Hospital Healthcare System Gangnam Center.

TEST	NEG	PMC5181813.xml	S51	Materials and methods	NEG	Contrast enhancement was automatically calculated by placing the region-of-interest cursor over the vessel of interest, that is, the abdominal aorta, and the level of the trigger threshold was set at an increase of 100 Hounsfield units.
TEST	NEG	PMC5181813.xml	S154	Discussion	POS	However, individuals who visited the SNUH GC for health screening examinations reside predominantly in the urban area, which was not adjusted in this study.

TEST	NEG	PMC5181815.xml	S86	Discussion	NEG	Positive immunostaining for melanocytic markers (HMB-45 and/or melan-A) and smooth muscle (actin and/or desmin) are the most histological findings.
TEST	NEG	PMC5181815.xml	S95	Discussion	NEG	Keeping enough margin during the surgical resection is considered as the gold standard for the treatment of hepatic PEComa.[31]
TEST	NEG	PMC5181816.xml	S6	Abstract	NEG	The aim of this study was to examine the association between MTHFR C677T genotype and IBD in the different Jewish populations.
TEST	NEG	PMC5181816.xml	S11	Abstract	NEG	Our findings suggest that the MTHFR 677T variant may contribute to the risk of CD in non-Ashkenazi but not Ashkenazi Jews.
TEST	NEG	PMC5181816.xml	S24	Introduction	NEG	Indeed, heterogeneity in the risk of IBD-associated loci among different populations has been described for several important IBD loci.
TEST	NEG	PMC5181816.xml	S39	Materials and methods	NEG	The subjects and the controls were divided to 2 subgroups by ethnicity (Ashkenazi and non-Ashkenazi Jews).
TEST	NEG	PMC5181817.xml	S24	Introduction	NEG	The dim light at night promotes melatonin secretion which keeps people sleep, whereas the high intensity of light at daytime, especially blue light inhibits melatonin secretion which keeps people awake.
TEST	NEG	PMC5181817.xml	S89	Discussion	NEG	Then, how the BF-IOL implantation will affect the quality of sleep in the cataract patient after surgery with comparing to their preoperative quality of sleep?
TEST	NEG	PMC5181817.xml	S94	Discussion	NEG	There would be 2 reasons for the improvement on the quality of sleep in the BF-IOL group after the cataract surgery.
TEST	NEG	PMC5181817.xml	S104	Discussion	NEG	Moreover, there were no significant differences shown between the 2 groups in each 7 independent sleep component at any 3 time points: preoperatively, 1 m and 12 m postoperatively (all P > 0.05).
TEST	NEG	PMC5181818.xml	S12	Abstract	NEG	In the total population, male patients with primary AS referred higher permanent work disability (13.2% vs 6.9%; P < 0.05), although no difference was observed in psoriatic or IBD spondylitis according to the gender.
TEST	NEG	PMC5181818.xml	S27	Introduction	NEG	Women report more frequent peripheral joint involvement and more functional disability, whereas the male gender is associated with axial involvement and more severe radiographic damage.[7,8]
TEST	NEG	PMC5181818.xml	S65	Results	NEG	Among primary AS patients, besides the common characteristics shown by the whole male SpA group, BASRI spine scores were also higher in men compared to women (mean BASRI spine 7.3 vs 5.8; P =  < 0.001).

SEMI	POS	PMC5207541.xml	S129	Discussion	POS	Genotype determination could be useful even in long-term VKA patients, to improve the quality of OAC therapy, by increasing the frequency of INR monitoring or identifying interacting drugs with greater accuracy.
SEMI	POS	PMC5207541.xml	S130	Discussion	POS	These considerations are of particular relevance in the elderly and in patients with decreased or impaired renal function, as VKAs remain the mainstay of anticoagulation therapy in these patients.
SEMI	POS	PMC5207541.xml	S131	Discussion	POS	Finally, implementation of pharmacogenetics could improve pharmacovigilance practice, as highlighted in guidelines recently released by the European Medicines Agency.[48]
SEMI	POS	PMC5207541.xml	S132	Discussion	POS	VKAs are one of the most common drugs resulting in emergency department admissions[49,50] and VKORC1 and CYP2C9 genetic variants may represent useful predictors of adverse drug reactions.
SEMI	POS	PMC5207541.xml	S133	Discussion	POS	In conclusion, our results suggest that the information on CYP2C9 and VKORC1 variants may potentially enable clinicians to determine individualized anticoagulant treatment for each patient; improve use, management and quality of VKA anticoagulation control; and monitor drug surveillance as part of pharmacovigilance programs.

SEMI	NEG	PMC5207549.xml	S26	Introduction	NEG	Memory and executive function have been assessed.
SEMI	NEG	PMC5207549.xml	S50	Materials and methods	NEG	The Stroop test (correct number of responses for word reading and naming the color of the font for 112 items during a 2-min period) was also used.

SEMI	NEG	PMC5207549.xml	S107	Materials and methods	NEG	The Wilcoxon's signed-rank test was used to compare the neuropsychological tests and biomarker assay results.
SEMI	NEG	PMC5207549.xml	S116	Results	NEG	Aβ1–42, T- tau, and P-tau181P levels tended to decrease, albeit not significantly so (Fig. 1).
SEMI	NEG	PMC5207549.xml	S120	Discussion	NEG	The S100B concentration decreased significantly 1 week after the operation compared to the basal value.
SEMI	NEG	PMC5207549.xml	S127	Discussion	NEG	Some studies have reported no difference in cognitive functions between patients undergoing general and regional anesthesia in a systematic review,[9] whereas others reported that general anesthesia was marginally associated with POCD in a meta-analysis.[10]
SEMI	NEG	PMC5207549.xml	S130	Discussion	NEG	The MMSE includes questions about orientation, word recall, attention, calculation, language skills, and the ability to follow complex commands.
SEMI	NEG	PMC5207549.xml	S135	Discussion	NEG	The levels of S100B are significantly higher in patients with POCD compared to those without; thus, S100B may be associated with POCD.[13]
SEMI	POS	PMC5207549.xml	S153	Discussion	POS	Our study had several limitations.
SEMI	POS	PMC5207549.xml	S154	Discussion	POS	First, lumbar CSF measures of biomarker levels may not be the most accurate measure of biomarker changes in the brain.
SEMI	POS	PMC5207549.xml	S155	Discussion	POS	However, there is no alternative method of measuring CSF biomarkers in a clinical setting.
SEMI	POS	PMC5207549.xml	S156	Discussion	POS	Obtaining CSF is a challenging procedure.
SEMI	POS	PMC5207549.xml	S157	Discussion	POS	Bilateral TKA was appropriate for this study, as it was part of patient care.
SEMI	POS	PMC5207549.xml	S158	Discussion	POS	Second, long-term follow-up, which may have shown the course of frontal dysfunction, was not performed.
SEMI	POS	PMC5207549.xml	S159	Discussion	POS	We performed this study to investigate POCD after TKA; further research is required to reveal the consequences of frontal dysfunction.
SEMI	POS	PMC5207549.xml	S160	Discussion	POS	In conclusion, we suggest that frontal-executive function can be affected 1 week after surgery in patients undergoing TKA with spinal anesthesia, but the cognitive decline is not definite.
SEMI	POS	PMC5207549.xml	S161	Discussion	POS	The analysis of CSF biomarkers showed that TKA under regional anesthesia might not cause neuronal injury.
SEMI	POS	PMC5207549.xml	S162	Discussion	POS	Frontal dysfunction after TKA may be associated with other causes.
SEMI	NEG	PMC5207550.xml	S24	Introduction	NEG	Echocardiography is a powerful, real-time imaging tool used to evaluate left ventricular (LV) function.
SEMI	NEG	PMC5207550.xml	S47	Methods	NEG	A random sequence using random number tables was generated by a cardiologist who was blinded to the study.
SEMI	NEG	PMC5207550.xml	S61	Methods	NEG	For segmental strain assessment, the myocardium was divided into several segments based on the results of the CAG.
SEMI	NEG	PMC5207550.xml	S72	Methods	NEG	The patients were asked to hold their breath at the end of expiration.
SEMI	NEG	PMC5207550.xml	S98	Methods	NEG	The participants were also cautioned not to run during exercise.
SEMI	NEG	PMC5207550.xml	S110	Methods	NEG	Categorical data were presented as frequencies and percentages (%).
SEMI	NEG	PMC5207550.xml	S113	Methods	NEG	Comparisons of parametric values among groups were performed with Student t test and the χ2 test when appropriate.
SEMI	NEG	PMC5207550.xml	S115	Methods	NEG	Differences in week-4 global and segmental strains between the groups were calculated by analysis of covariance using the baseline values as the covariate.
SEMI	NEG	PMC5207550.xml	S130	Results	NEG	From the 52 participants, we obtained segmental strains from 832 segments, of which 319 were defined as intervention segments, 179 as ischemic segments, and the remainder as normal segments.
SEMI	NEG	PMC5207550.xml	S136	Results	NEG	At the 4-week follow-up, when controlling for baseline values, the RG showed significant improvements in the SV, GLS, GRS, GCS, GAS, and LVEF compared with the CG (P <0.05), while no significant changes were observed for the HR, SBP, DBP, BMI, E/A Ratio, LVEDV, LVESV, CO, EDM, or ESM (P >0.05) (Table 4).
SEMI	NEG	PMC5207550.xml	S157	Discussion	NEG	Therefore, the measurements of the 3D longitudinal, radial, and circumferential strains should be able to reflect the LV global and segmental recovery of myocardial fiber directly after CR program.
SEMI	NEG	PMC5207550.xml	S164	Discussion	NEG	They found that GLS had superior prognostic value to LVEF for predicting major adverse cardiac events.
SEMI	NEG	PMC5207550.xml	S167	Discussion	NEG	This finding might indicate that the recovery of myocardial function starts from the segment of myocardium first.
SEMI	NEG	PMC5207550.xml	S168	Discussion	NEG	However, in our analysis, both the global and segmental strains had statistically improvement in the RG than in the CG, as shown in Tables 4 and 5.
SEMI	NEG	PMC5207550.xml	S169	Discussion	NEG	Such different results might be attributed to the fact that radial and circumferential strain does not represent a specific set of muscle fibers.[18]
SEMI	NEG	PMC5207550.xml	S179	Discussion	NEG	For left ventricular strain measurements performed in each of the 3 views, intraobserver ICCs were ≥0.92 among time points spanning a total 24-week period, while the interobserver ICCs were ≥0.82 for all global strain measurements.
SEMI	NEG	PMC5207550.xml	S211	Discussion	NEG	Telephone interview with discharged patients is an effective intervention to improve compliance with the treatment plan, improve communication between doctors and patients, perfect rehabilitation treatment, and decrease cost savings resulting from this intervention.[28]
SEMI	POS	PMC5207550.xml	S221	Discussion	POS	Several limitations of our study should be highlighted in the end of this paper.
SEMI	POS	PMC5207550.xml	S222	Discussion	POS	First, this study had a small number of participants at a single center.
SEMI	POS	PMC5207550.xml	S223	Discussion	POS	The CR program is short-term (4 weeks) intervention in the outpatient phase.
SEMI	POS	PMC5207550.xml	S224	Discussion	POS	Further studies with a larger sample size and a longer CR intervention phase are warranted to validate the impact of our CR program on the improvement of LV function.
SEMI	POS	PMC5207550.xml	S225	Discussion	POS	Another limitation of the study was the reference method to evaluate the myocardial ischemia using the results of the CAG.
SEMI	POS	PMC5207550.xml	S226	Discussion	POS	Because it is affected by the self-adjustment mechanism of the coronary circulatory system and dependent on the type of dominant coronary artery, the supply of myocardial perfusion and the degree of coronary artery stenosis were not the same.
SEMI	POS	PMC5207550.xml	S227	Discussion	POS	The metabolic energy of cardiac muscle cells in the coronary system is demonstration by the microcirculation, which involves the micro artery and the small vein.
SEMI	POS	PMC5207550.xml	S228	Discussion	POS	Therefore, the segment with impaired function was not always aligned with the anatomy of the coronary arteries and may occur in patients without angiographically significant stenosis, which might lead to the inaccurate grouping of ischemic or normal segments.
SEMI	POS	PMC5207550.xml	S229	Discussion	POS	Our early, home-based CR program was lack of the information regarding functional capacity to modify the intensity or progression of the exercise training.
SEMI	POS	PMC5207550.xml	S230	Discussion	POS	This may limit the ability to adjust the rehabilitation as needed.
SEMI	POS	PMC5207550.xml	S231	Discussion	POS	The exercise test was not performed in our study because our study is a short-term rehabilitation study after AMI.
SEMI	POS	PMC5207550.xml	S232	Discussion	POS	There is certainly a risk to perform intense exercise test for these patients in the treadmill at the early stage after PCI treatment.
SEMI	POS	PMC5207550.xml	S233	Discussion	POS	The exercise intensity of our CR program was designed to reach approximately 60% HRmax.
SEMI	POS	PMC5207550.xml	S234	Discussion	POS	The intensity of the exercise treadmill test in our hospital using a Bruce treadmill protocol reached approximately 85% HRmax.
SEMI	POS	PMC5207550.xml	S235	Discussion	POS	Furthermore, myocardial function recovery was proven to start earlier than skeletal muscle recovery for our CR program.[31]
SEMI	POS	PMC5207550.xml	S236	Discussion	POS	Therefore, it is better to evaluate the cardiac function directly than the skeletal function.
SEMI	POS	PMC5207550.xml	S237	Discussion	POS	After careful consideration, we thus did not carry out the exercise test.
SEMI	NEG	PMC5207551.xml	S5	Abstract	NEG	Additionally, there are no specific imaging or laboratory tests, except histopathology.

SEMI	NEG	PMC5207554.xml	S87	Results	NEG	According to diabetes self-management, significantly increased proportions were found in diabetes diet compliance, exercise, SMBG, basal-bolus insulin treatment, and complication screening according to CPGs.
SEMI	NEG	PMC5207554.xml	S90	Results	NEG	Participants with basal-bolus approach, higher frequency of SMBG, higher diabetes diet compliance, more physical activity, shorter diabetes duration exhibited greater improvement in glycemic control in DMP.
SEMI	POS	PMC5207554.xml	S170	Discussion	POS	This study had several limitations.
SEMI	POS	PMC5207554.xml	S171	Discussion	POS	Participants were recruited using convenience sampling from 6 hospitals in Shantou city.
SEMI	POS	PMC5207554.xml	S172	Discussion	POS	This may limit the generalizability of the results.
SEMI	POS	PMC5207554.xml	S173	Discussion	POS	Further studies should include larger samples, with more diverse participant populations.
SEMI	POS	PMC5207554.xml	S174	Discussion	POS	In addition, we used a cohort study design; case-control studies should be carried out to confirm the effectiveness of DMP.
SEMI	POS	PMC5207554.xml	S175	Discussion	POS	Finally, follow-up duration could be longer.
SEMI	NEG	PMC5207555.xml	S15	Introduction	NEG	Studies have found that rectal power and sensory abnormalities contributed to FC.[2]
SEMI	NEG	PMC5207555.xml	S53	Methods	NEG	The size of the numbers and symbols were No.25,
SEMI	NEG	PMC5207555.xml	S55	Methods	NEG	The experiment was performed in a soundproof electroencephalogram (EEG) suite by specialized professionals.
SEMI	NEG	PMC5207555.xml	S112	Discussion	NEG	Those findings suggested that high activity of the prefrontal region could be viewed as the psychological and physiological mechanisms of both anxiety and IBS.
SEMI	NEG	PMC5207556.xml	S36	Methods	NEG	Then, an abdominal exploration was performed to identify the superficial anatomical landmarks (e.g., the urachus, umbilical folds, epigastric vessels, spermatic vessels, and vas deferens or round ligament of the uterus) as well as the site and type of hernia (Table 2).
SEMI	NEG	PMC5207556.xml	S52	Results	NEG	Forceps-assisted pulling was needed in 45 patients, and hernia sac incision was performed in 9 patients.
SEMI	NEG	PMC5207556.xml	S98	Discussion	NEG	It should be noted that careful observation of dynamic changes within the groin area and proper antibiotic treatment in some cases are necessary.
SEMI	NEG	PMC5207556.xml	S110	Conclusion	NEG	However, it requires experienced surgeons to ensure safety with special attention paid to the key technical points as well as complication management.
SEMI	NEG	PMC5207557.xml	S23	Introduction	NEG	Specific treatment is not available for hantavirus infection.[1]
SEMI	NEG	PMC5207557.xml	S39	Introduction	NEG	As the prediction of disease severity is still of utmost importance in the treatment of hantavirus infection, we particularly compared the relationship of our findings with the clinical disease severity.
SEMI	NEG	PMC5207557.xml	S86	Methods	NEG	The limit of significance was set at 0.05 (2-tailed).
SEMI	NEG	PMC5207557.xml	S155	Discussion	NEG	In HIV-infected patients, c-mPl expression per platelet is elevated, and recombinant human megakaryocytic growth factor reduces the c-mPl expression and restores platelet count to normal level.[16]
SEMI	NEG	PMC5207558.xml	S9	Abstract	NEG	The patient underwent a pulmonary lobectomy.
SEMI	NEG	PMC5207558.xml	S35	Case presentation	NEG	A high-resolution computer tomography scan of the chest confirmed the presence of a large mass in the left lung adjacent to the pleura that locally compressed the left oblique crack to camber without mediastinal lymphadenopathy (Fig. 1A and B).
SEMI	NEG	PMC5207558.xml	S74	Case presentation	NEG	After the fourth course of chemotherapy, the β-HCG decreased to 0.91 IU/L.
SEMI	NEG	PMC5207558.xml	S115	Discussion	NEG	The diagnosis is usually delayed until the patient is in the middle-late stage of the disease.
SEMI	NEG	PMC5207559.xml	S3	Abstract	NEG	The aim of this study was to evaluate the effect of vitamin D supplementation in women with hypovitaminosis D and “small burden” uterine fibroids.
SEMI	NEG	PMC5207559.xml	S94	Results	NEG	No correlation was found between 25-OH-D3 baseline levels and the number of fibroids per patient (r = −0.10, P = 0.16).
SEMI	NEG	PMC5207559.xml	S114	Results	NEG	At the call back visit (performed 12 months after the starting of appropriate vitamin D supplementation therapy), the mean 25-OH-D3 serum level in these women was 30.7 ± 10.5 ng/mL; thus the difference was statistically significant (19.9 ± 1.0 vs 30.7 ± 10.5 ng/mL; P < 0.001).
SEMI	NEG	PMC5207559.xml	S170	Discussion	NEG	No significant differences were found in diameter or in volume of the identified fibroids in the study group, while a slight but significant increase in diameter and volume was noted in the control group.
SEMI	NEG	PMC5207560.xml	S5	Abstract	NEG	Hence, there is an unmet clinical need for additional risk stratification.
SEMI	NEG	PMC5207560.xml	S7	Abstract	NEG	Therefore, the objective of this study was to examine the association between clinical and echocardiographic determinants (including valve morphology) and aortic dimension and the progression rate of dilatation.
SEMI	NEG	PMC5207560.xml	S8	Abstract	NEG	Aortic dimensions were assessed on serial echocardiographic images between 1999 and 2014 in a population of 392 patients with BAVs in a tertiary care center in the Netherlands.
SEMI	NEG	PMC5207560.xml	S13	Abstract	NEG	Dilatation rate was not associated with valve morphology.
SEMI	NEG	PMC5207560.xml	S21	Introduction	NEG	Because of the association with aortic dilatation, BAV is considered as an aortopathy rather than a stand-alone valvulopathy.
SEMI	NEG	PMC5207560.xml	S27	Introduction	NEG	Secondly, the hemodynamic consequences of BAV on aortic tissue by abnormal mechanical (local) stress (overload).[15,16]
SEMI	NEG	PMC5207560.xml	S47	Methods	NEG	Secondly, the exact fusion type was reported by description of the fusion patterns between the right coronary cusp (RCC), left coronary cusp (LCC), and noncoronary cusp (NCC).
SEMI	NEG	PMC5207560.xml	S53	Methods	NEG	The maximal diameter perpendicular to the axis of the aorta was taken (Fig. 1).[6]
SEMI	NEG	PMC5207560.xml	S69	Results	NEG	In this single-center study, 392 patients with a BAV with serial echocardiographic images available were enrolled.
SEMI	NEG	PMC5207560.xml	S86	Results	NEG	The significantly associated parameters for all aortic dimensions are listed in Table 2.
SEMI	NEG	PMC5207560.xml	S89	Results	NEG	Increasing age was associated with larger dimensions of all segments except for dimensions of the LVOT.
SEMI	POS	PMC5207560.xml	S137	Discussion	POS	Although the study population size was relatively large and the aortic measurements were repeated prospectively by 2 independent observers, some possible limitations merit attention.
SEMI	POS	PMC5207560.xml	S138	Discussion	POS	Despite the size, this study is prone to some bias due to its retrospective observational design.
SEMI	POS	PMC5207560.xml	S139	Discussion	POS	On the other hand, our hospital is a combined regional and tertiary center serving its own population.
SEMI	POS	PMC5207560.xml	S140	Discussion	POS	With that, we assume we evaluated a representative population when compared to populations in exclusively tertiary centers.
SEMI	POS	PMC5207560.xml	S141	Discussion	POS	Another limitation is inherent to the serial echocardiographic measurements.
SEMI	POS	PMC5207560.xml	S142	Discussion	POS	Measurements are dependent on image quality and availability of echocardiographic images.
SEMI	POS	PMC5207560.xml	S143	Discussion	POS	We tried to minimalize bias based on image quality by requiring valid measurements from independent observers.
SEMI	POS	PMC5207560.xml	S144	Discussion	POS	Aortic dilatation is a lifelong process, necessitating long-term follow-up in clinical studies.
SEMI	POS	PMC5207560.xml	S145	Discussion	POS	Thus, aortic dilatation is frequently studied in retrospective cohorts.
SEMI	POS	PMC5207560.xml	S146	Discussion	POS	Although the retrospective study design inherently involves some limitations, the current manuscript represents the natural clinical course of BAV patients within our institution.
SEMI	POS	PMC5207560.xml	S147	Discussion	POS	These results have to be interpreted with caution in a population with a tricuspid aortic valve, since this group was not included in the present study and might show another natural clinical course of aortic dilatation when compared to patients with BAV.
SEMI	POS	PMC5207560.xml	S148	Discussion	POS	Finally, despite the relatively large population size, the group of patients with a monocuspid aortic valve was relatively small and reliability of the analyses considering this group was considered low and was not included in this study.
SEMI	NEG	PMC5207560.xml	S156	Discussion	NEG	Finally, there is an unmet clinical need for improvement of risk stratification in BAV patients.
SEMI	NEG	PMC5207561.xml	S34	Case presentation	NEG	Patient was treated with systemic steroid treatment.
SEMI	NEG	PMC5207561.xml	S35	Case presentation	NEG	After 6 months of treatment, the patient underwent FDG PET/CT for therapeutic response assessment in April 2015.
SEMI	NEG	PMC5207561.xml	S40	Discussion	NEG	Sarcoidosis is an idiopathic systemic inflammatory granulomatous disorder comprised of epithelioid and multinucleated giant cells with little necrosis.[1]
SEMI	NEG	PMC5207561.xml	S50	Discussion	NEG	Previous studies have shown that FDG PET/CT can be used to accurately assess inflammatory activity in patients with persistent symptoms without biological inflammatory activity, especially in uncommon localizations or when a biopsy is not possible.[9]
SEMI	NEG	PMC5207564.xml	S27	Introduction	NEG	In an animal model, topical administration of melatonin lowered IOP in a dose-dependent manner.[13]
SEMI	NEG	PMC5207564.xml	S67	Subjects, materials, and methods	NEG	Blood pressure (BP) was measured from the right arm using a standard mercury sphygmomanometer (Baumanometer, WA Baum Co, New York) after 5 minutes of rest in a sitting position.
SEMI	NEG	PMC5207564.xml	S89	Subjects, materials, and methods	NEG	IOP was not taken into consideration when establishing a diagnosis of OAG.
SEMI	NEG	PMC5207564.xml	S101	Subjects, materials, and methods	NEG	Patients were assigned to the overweight subgroup if their BMI was ≥25 kg/m2 or if they had abdominal obesity (based on waist circumference).
SEMI	NEG	PMC5207565.xml	S7	Abstract	NEG	The slope of the spectral curve and the lesion effective atomic number were calculated.
SEMI	NEG	PMC5207565.xml	S25	Introduction	NEG	MRI has high sensitivity for bladder cancer and shows the relationship between prostate and posterior wall of bladder, but it is only indicated if CT is contraindicated.
SEMI	NEG	PMC5207565.xml	S42	Materials and methods	NEG	Among the 236 patients, 118 had surgical or pathological confirmation and were included in this study.
SEMI	NEG	PMC5207565.xml	S69	Results	NEG	There was a statistically significant difference in CT value between bladder cancer group and BPH group at energy levels from 40 to 90 keV, with the biggest difference at 40 keV (median and interquartile range: 83.3 HU and 22.9 HU vs 60.6 HU and 16.7 HU, Z = 5.932, P < 0.001).
SEMI	NEG	PMC5207565.xml	S82	Discussion	NEG	Both bladder cancer and BPH have densities of soft tissue, and this average effect greatly reduces the CT number difference between bladder cancer and BPH.
SEMI	NEG	PMC5207565.xml	S86	Discussion	NEG	Previous study[23] has shown that the signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) and contrast-to-noise ratio (CNR) of tissues and organs in monochromatic images are both greater than those in polychromatic images, and the monochromatic image quality is also better.
SEMI	NEG	PMC5207565.xml	S87	Discussion	NEG	Compared with polychromatic CT, dual-energy spectral CT imaging with multiple parameters provides more analysis tools and quantitative indicators.
SEMI	NEG	PMC5207565.xml	S92	Discussion	NEG	Our study indicated that the slope of the spectral HU curve for bladder cancer was significantly higher than that for BPH; bladder cancer GSI curve was routing more sharply than BPH GSI curve.
SEMI	POS	PMC5207565.xml	S97	Discussion	POS	Our study did have several limitations.
SEMI	POS	PMC5207565.xml	S98	Discussion	POS	First, we did not research the difference between different stages of bladder cancer with BPH.
SEMI	POS	PMC5207565.xml	S99	Discussion	POS	Second, only one slope (k) value for the spectral HU curve was calculated in our study.
SEMI	POS	PMC5207565.xml	S100	Discussion	POS	In reality, the slope of the curve changes with photon energy, owing to the nonlinear nature of the attenuation.
SEMI	POS	PMC5207565.xml	S101	Discussion	POS	The single slope value covering the whole energy range used in this study can only reflect the average attenuation effect.
SEMI	POS	PMC5207565.xml	S102	Discussion	POS	However, whether or not the use of multiple slopes can improve the accuracy needs further study.
SEMI	POS	PMC5207565.xml	S103	Discussion	POS	Finally, not all the bladder cancers in our study were on posterior wall, and we did not analyze the difference between them in iodine contrast imaging.
SEMI	POS	PMC5207565.xml	S104	Discussion	POS	We will collect more bladder cancer on posterior wall and explore the potential of iodine contrast application in our future study to make the result better.
SEMI	NEG	PMC5207567.xml	S32		NEG	Patients were excluded if they were coinfected by other viruses or had a history of other serious chronic diseases.
SEMI	NEG	PMC5207567.xml	S77		NEG	Because the viral load of all the deceased cases were above 104 copies/mL (Supplementary Table 2), the AURCs of SFTSI and viral loads for the prediction of hospital mortality among patients with viral load >104 copies/mL were further detected and showed that the AURC of SFTSI was obviously higher than the AURC of virus alone (0.936 vs 0.821) (Fig. 2).
SEMI	NEG	PMC5207567.xml	S105		NEG	Furthermore, compared with the sole factor of viral load for predicting the outcomes, SFTSI had a higher accuracy, especially among patients with a high viral load.
SEMI	NEG	PMC5207567.xml	S106		NEG	We are undertaking a prospective study on a larger cohort of SFTS patients hospitalized in our hospital in 2016 to validate the predictive value of this model.
SEMI	NEG	PMC5207568.xml	S14	Introduction	NEG	In patients with moyamoya disease, a standard surgical therapeutic option is direct revascularization surgery, such as superficial temporal artery-middle cerebral artery (STA-MCA) anastomosis.[1]
SEMI	NEG	PMC5207568.xml	S15	Introduction	NEG	Direct revascularization surgery can increase cerebral perfusion, thereby reducing the potential risk for cerebral ischemia.
SEMI	NEG	PMC5207568.xml	S16	Introduction	NEG	However, there is a potential risk for neurological complications due to cerebral hyperperfusion, which is called cerebral hyperperfusion syndrome (CHS) and it has been reported to occur in up to 50% of patients after STA-MCA anastomosis.[1–3]
SEMI	NEG	PMC5207568.xml	S116	Discussion	NEG	Taken together, although our result did not support the protective effect of dexmedetomidine on postoperative CHS, we believe that the use of intraoperative dexmedetomidine may at least affect the clinical course of postoperative CHS.

SEMI	POS	PMC5207587.xml	S146	Discussion	POS	Our study has several limitations.
SEMI	POS	PMC5207587.xml	S147	Discussion	POS	First, patients and the investigator who performed the nerve blocks were not blinded to the treatment.
SEMI	POS	PMC5207587.xml	S148	Discussion	POS	We did not find it appropriate to perform 2 invasive procedures in each patient.
SEMI	POS	PMC5207587.xml	S149	Discussion	POS	Instead, a dressing covered the actual or estimated needle insertion site of ACB and FNB for all patients, with the purpose of blinding those assessing the outcome to the procedure.
SEMI	POS	PMC5207587.xml	S150	Discussion	POS	Second, our observation period was limited to 48 hours postoperatively, and we could not account for conclusions and potential complications detected thereafter.

SEMI	NEG	PMC5207589.xml	S90	Discussion	NEG	In the present study, the right adrenal artery was more commonly involved than the left adrenal artery because of the close anatomic relationship between the right adrenal artery and the HCC.
SEMI	NEG	PMC5207589.xml	S110	Discussion	NEG	First, several findings should prompt the performance of a selective extrahepatic collateral arteriogram, including a hypertrophied adrenal artery that runs toward the region of the tumor, defective or missing staining of the tumor on hepatic arteriogram, and defective iodized oil retention or progression of the peripheral portion of the tumor after TAE/TACE therapy.
SEMI	NEG	PMC5207590.xml	S23	Introduction	NEG	It possesses various biological functions[6] and is involved in many cellular reactions such as shaping of blood vessel, promoting cell migration, accelerating collagen deposition, promoting wound healing, inhibiting fibrosis, and so on.[7–9]

SEMI	NEG	PMC5207593.xml	S16	Introduction	NEG	In recent decades, syphilis has made a dramatic resurgence in China.[2,3]
SEMI	NEG	PMC5207593.xml	S18	Introduction	NEG	Because syphilis patients are the only sources of syphilis transmission, the early diagnosis and treatment of syphilis not only can effectively control the spread of syphilis but also are of great significance for health planning and management.[3,5]
SEMI	NEG	PMC5207593.xml	S45	Methods	NEG	The inclusion criteria were as follows:(1)The patients must have had a first-time diagnosis of early syphilis (in the primary, secondary, or early latent stages).(2)The patients must have had at least 2 serological titers within 24 months, with 1 titer at or around the date of treatment, that is, baseline titer.(3)The patients must have had regular follow-ups at 3, 6, 9, 12, 18, and 24 months posttreatment to review their clinical symptoms and serum RPR titers.(4)The patients must have received a recommended regimen based on the national Sexually Transmitted Infections Guidelines even if the syphilis patients were coinfected with other STDs, including Ureaplasma urealyticum, Mycoplasma hominis, Chlamydia trachomatis, or Neisseria gonorrhoeae.

SEMI	NEG	PMC5207593.xml	S101	Discussion	NEG	In addition, some cases have indicated that the serological response rates to doxycycline and BPG therapy were similar in HIV-infected patients with early syphilis after 6 and 12 months.
SEMI	POS	PMC5207593.xml	S124	Discussion	POS	The view presented in this study had no conclusive evidence until now, as research discussing the treatment of syphilis with minocycline is rare.
SEMI	POS	PMC5207593.xml	S125	Discussion	POS	Moreover, we cannot ensure the compliance of all patients with oral drug regimens.
SEMI	POS	PMC5207593.xml	S126	Discussion	POS	In addition, because of a lack of data, our surveillance study excluded both pregnant and HIV-positive patients, which limits the generalizability of the results.
SEMI	POS	PMC5207593.xml	S127	Discussion	POS	Treating pregnant patients for syphilis with minocycline was forbidden because of the teratogenic risk; in addition, the treatment of syphilis patients coinfected with HIV remains unevaluated.
SEMI	POS	PMC5207593.xml	S128	Discussion	POS	Additional considerations include the limited research data and short follow-up periods.

SEMI	NEG	PMC5213994.xml	S164		NEG	It is conceivable that the rate of informed choice decreases once NIPT is offered outside the study context.
SEMI	POS	PMC5213994.xml	S179		POS	Moreover, although the MMIC is often used as a measure of informed choice for screening, it does have some limitations.
SEMI	POS	PMC5213994.xml	S180		POS	It requires a knowledge measure that is specific to the condition being tested, but because there is no gold standard for good knowledge this is subjective.34

SEMI	NEG	PMC5215153.xml	S20	Background	NEG	Ensuring that skill mix is consistently adequate should reduce use of restraint.
SEMI	NEG	PMC5215153.xml	S23	INTRODUCTION	NEG	Defined by the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services (CMS) as “any manual method, physical or mechanical device, material, or equipment attached to or adjacent to the resident’s body that the individual cannot remove easily which restricts freedom of movement or normal access to one’s body,”5 physical restraints can include belts, mittens, vests, bedrails, geriatric chairs, and other devices.
SEMI	NEG	PMC5215153.xml	S35	METHODS	NEG	NDNQI participation is voluntary.
SEMI	NEG	PMC5215153.xml	S43	METHODS	NEG	For each restrained patient, unit personnel indicate the clinical justification for restraint by choosing one or more of the following: prevent from falling by getting out of bed without assistance, prevent from removing medical equipment or therapeutic modalities, reduce potential for inflicting harm to others, reduce potential for inflicting harm to self, other, and unknown.
SEMI	NEG	PMC5215153.xml	S44	METHODS	NEG	These data, along with the unit census on the day of the survey, are reported to the NDNQI.
SEMI	NEG	PMC5215153.xml	S53	METHODS	NEG	As a measure of staffing level we computed quarterly total nursing hours per patient day (TNHPPD) for each unit as the sum of total nursing care hours for the quarter divided by total inpatient days for the quarter.
SEMI	NEG	PMC5215153.xml	S59	METHODS	NEG	Hospital demographic variables included US census region, bed size (<300 or ≥300 beds), teaching status, and location (metropolitan or non-metropolitan).
SEMI	NEG	PMC5215153.xml	S70	METHODS	NEG	Year and quarter were included as classification variables to control for time trend and seasonality.
SEMI	NEG	PMC5215153.xml	S93	RESULTS	NEG	Restraint rates were highest in quarters for which staffing level or skill mix was below unit average.
SEMI	NEG	PMC5215153.xml	S104	RESULTS	NEG	As shown in Table 3, odds of both types of restraint decreased each year, as did restraint prevalence rates, which fell by about 50 % during the study period (see Table 2).
SEMI	POS	PMC5215153.xml	S125	DISCUSSION	POS	One limitation of our study is the non-random sample, which may not be representative.
SEMI	POS	PMC5215153.xml	S126	DISCUSSION	POS	Larger hospitals and Magnet-designated facilities are disproportionately represented in the NDNQI, for example.
SEMI	POS	PMC5215153.xml	S127	DISCUSSION	POS	However, we controlled for several hospital characteristic variables in our study, and we doubt that staffing-restraint associations differ enough across hospital sizes and types for the non-random nature of our sample to undermine the generalizability of our basic findings.
SEMI	POS	PMC5215153.xml	S128	DISCUSSION	POS	Our quarterly data had limited granularity.
SEMI	POS	PMC5215153.xml	S129	DISCUSSION	POS	The size of the effects we observed despite this limitation suggests a robust association between skill mix and restraint use.
SEMI	POS	PMC5215153.xml	S130	DISCUSSION	POS	We would expect analyses of week- or shift-level data to yield similar results, but the NDNQI does not collect data at this level, so this is a question for further research.
SEMI	POS	PMC5215153.xml	S131	DISCUSSION	POS	Another study limitation was the lack of data on potentially important covariates, including patient acuity and fall risk, units’ use of non-nursing staff such as sitters to prevent falls, and the presence of family in the patient’s room.
SEMI	POS	PMC5215153.xml	S132	DISCUSSION	POS	We could not fully control for between- or within-unit differences on these covariates, but our use of each unit as its own control makes this less of a concern.
SEMI	POS	PMC5215153.xml	S133	DISCUSSION	POS	Moreover, the effect of skill mix category was remarkably constant regardless of the covariates included in the model, despite some of these covariates having substantial effects in their own right (see Table 4).
SEMI	POS	PMC5215153.xml	S134	DISCUSSION	POS	Our approach of using each unit as its own control required each unit analyzed to have at least one quarter with and one quarter without restraint use, limiting our sample of units.
SEMI	POS	PMC5215153.xml	S135	DISCUSSION	POS	However, our study sample was comparable in most respects to the set of units excluded for never reporting restraint use, and we think the staffing-restraint use association we found likely holds quite generally among units where restraints are used at least on occasion.
SEMI	POS	PMC5215153.xml	S136	DISCUSSION	POS	In future research, examination of data from units reporting restraint use in every quarter would likely yield further insight into the relation between staffing and restraint use.
SEMI	NEG	PMC5215153.xml	S145	Conclusion	NEG	We found that when unit skill mix was low, hospital staff were apparently more likely to use restraints, including restraints for fall prevention.
SEMI	NEG	PMC5215153.xml	S149	Conclusion	NEG	In light of a projected RN shortage, future research on nurse-sensitive outcomes, including restraint use, should focus on optimizing available nursing hours at the bedside through innovative staffing models and improvements in the work environment.40 , 41

SEMI	NEG	PMC5217194.xml	S118	Results	NEG	These results suggest that CSE triggers ubiquitination at the K689 site to accelerate NLRP3 degradation because the K689R mutant exhibited a longer t ½.
SEMI	NEG	PMC5217194.xml	S146	Discussion	NEG	Our study shows that CSE decreases the level of NLRP3 protein via increased degradation, most likely increased ubiquitin-mediated proteasomal processing.

SEMI	NEG	PMC5217212.xml	S186	Discussion	NEG	Further research is needed to elucidate the mechanism by which the ERK1/2 pathway enhances the transcription of ADAM33.
SEMI	NEG	PMC5217320.xml	S26	Background	NEG	Viral infections are also associated with more severe exacerbations [4].
SEMI	NEG	PMC5217320.xml	S130	Discussion	NEG	In normal primary human bronchial epithelial cell cultures, HRV itself upregulated membrane-bound ICAM-1 expression via NF-κβ-dependent mechanisms [15], suggesting a potential vicious cycle.
SEMI	NEG	PMC5217320.xml	S135	Discussion	NEG	Although respiratory tract ciliated cells are thought to be the major target for microbial pathogens, large airway goblet cells, an integral part of respiratory epithelium, and submucosal glandular cells, may also be involved.
SEMI	POS	PMC5217320.xml	S150	Discussion	POS	There are also a few limitations.
SEMI	POS	PMC5217320.xml	S151	Discussion	POS	Firstly, the study was cross-sectional and longitudinal studies of ICAM-1 expression are needed.

SEMI	POS	PMC5217768.xml	S135		POS	While a potential weakness of composite endpoints is that they may be driven largely by one or two components and thus might not provide useful information if the components are not clinically appropriate to combine, we believe our composite endpoint is clinically useful because it includes the outcomes that generally would necessitate admission to hospital.
SEMI	POS	PMC5217768.xml	S136		POS	Furthermore, this composite endpoint has been used in several previous studies in this area.12 13 29
SEMI	POS	PMC5217768.xml	S137		POS	Using our composite endpoint, if patients can be identified as unlikely to need transfusion or haemostatic intervention, or die, then most doctors would be comfortable discharging them from the emergency department for outpatient management.
SEMI	POS	PMC5217768.xml	S138		POS	A weakness of our study was that we excluded patients who were already inpatients when they developed upper gastrointestinal bleeding.
SEMI	POS	PMC5217768.xml	S139		POS	These patients are already known to be at high risk of poor outcome.
SEMI	POS	PMC5217768.xml	S140		POS	In addition, 31% of patients did not undergo endoscopy.
SEMI	POS	PMC5217768.xml	S141		POS	In three centres, there was a guideline to not admit patients with Glasgow Blatchford scores of either 1 or less or 2 or less and aged less than 70 years, and many did not attend for outpatient endoscopy.
SEMI	POS	PMC5217768.xml	S142		POS	In addition, some clinicians decided endoscopy was not required after an apparent trivial bleed, or was deemed inappropriate for some ill patients with multiple comorbidities.
SEMI	POS	PMC5217768.xml	S143		POS	Interestingly, the UK national audit on upper gastrointestinal bleeding reported that 26% of patients notified to gastroenterologists did not have inpatient endoscopy.11
SEMI	POS	PMC5217768.xml	S144		POS	We do not believe this had a major effect on our study findings, as 95% of patients were followed up for 30 days after presentation.
SEMI	POS	PMC5217768.xml	S145		POS	Importantly, the usefulness of risk scores that require endoscopy is limited because endoscopy (if undertaken) is often delayed for up to 24 hours or more, whereas clinicians generally want risk stratification early after presentation.
SEMI	POS	PMC5217768.xml	S146		POS	A fairly large number of patients had missing values for full Rockall score (largely as a result of not undergoing endoscopy) or AIMS65 score (largely due to lack of measurement of albumin).
SEMI	POS	PMC5217768.xml	S147		POS	Although 30 day mortality was similar in patients with and without missing values for both scoring systems, those with missing values had lower values of the other scores and less often underwent intervention, which could lead to an underestimation of the ability of the AIMS65 score to identify low risk patients.
SEMI	POS	PMC5217768.xml	S148		POS	However, in the centre with the lowest missing values for AIMS65 score (Odense at 1.9%), subgroup analysis confirmed our main finding that the Glasgow Blatchford score had a higher discriminative ability to predict need for intervention or death compared with other risk scores, including AIMS65.
SEMI	POS	PMC5217768.xml	S149		POS	All data on patients managed as outpatients were included.
SEMI	POS	PMC5217768.xml	S150		POS	In these outpatients, apart from performance of endoscopy they were otherwise assessed, investigated, and managed in the same way as all others and were followed up at 30 days using patient records.
SEMI	POS	PMC5217768.xml	S151		POS	None of those managed as outpatients died and none required transfusion, surgery, or interventional radiology; endoscopic treatment was undertaken in one (a 28 year old with a minor Mallory-Weiss tear.).
SEMI	POS	PMC5217768.xml	S152		POS	Therefore we do not believe that these policies had a major impact on our conclusions.
SEMI	POS	PMC5217768.xml	S153		POS	The power calculation for mortality was based on AIMS65 and full Rockall scores.
SEMI	POS	PMC5217768.xml	S154		POS	Using our baseline assumptions, the number of patients in our study with full data on AIMS65 and full Rockall scores still provided 80% power to predict mortality.
SEMI	POS	PMC5217768.xml	S155		POS	For our primary endpoint of intervention or death, using previous AUROC data for AIMS65 score of 0.7 and for the Glasgow Blatchford score of 0.8 (worst case value) and power of 90%, we needed only approximately 500 patients.30
SEMI	POS	PMC5217768.xml	S156		POS	Therefore we believe we achieved sufficient power in this study, which is the largest prospective study on this topic to date.
SEMI	NEG	PMC5217768.xml	S167		NEG	This compares favourably with accepted low risk thresholds of commonly used scores for other medical conditions, including CURB65 for chest infection and the pulmonary embolism severity index.32 33
SEMI	NEG	PMC5217768.xml	S185		NEG	Using low and high scores to direct patient care to outpatient management or urgent endoscopy and higher level care has been suggested
SEMI	NEG	PMC5220619.xml	S3	Background	NEG	Specific resistance loops appear in different shapes influenced by different resistive properties of the airways, yet their descriptive ability is compressed to a single parameter - its slope.
SEMI	NEG	PMC5220619.xml	S54	Methods	NEG	It appears in an interval from 0 to 1, where 0 means complete closure of the loop (flat line) while 1 means a perfect circle.
SEMI	NEG	PMC5220619.xml	S127	Discussion	NEG	One possible explanation may be found in the competition for space between lung areas that are emptied during expiration with areas that are trapped with air and progressively compress adjacent airways during expiration.
SEMI	NEG	PMC5220619.xml	S144	Discussion	NEG	Looking at the slope per se, our data suggest to use sG0.5 instead of or with sGAW (computed as sGmid) due to its potential to discriminate obstructive asthma from mild COPD.
SEMI	NEG	PMC5223330.xml	S37	Methods	NEG	Participants provided written informed consent.
SEMI	NEG	PMC5223330.xml	S45	Methods	NEG	In the LifeLines cohort 227,981 SNPs were included and in the Vlagtwedde-Vlaardingen cohort 242,926 SNPs were included.
SEMI	NEG	PMC5223330.xml	S85	Discussion	NEG	However, when we assessed these associations in the replication cohorts, the total number of significant associations in the replication meta-analysis is less than expected by chance (i.e.
SEMI	NEG	PMC5223330.xml	S92	Discussion	NEG	Susceptibility to these various exposures may be genetically determined and susceptibility loci may differ between exposures.
SEMI	NEG	PMC5223343.xml	S55	Methods	NEG	Exon array quality control and outlier detection was performed using dChip (www.dchip.org, [19]).
SEMI	NEG	PMC5223343.xml	S61	Methods	NEG	Gene Set Enrichment Analysis was used to calculate positional enrichment of abnormal transcription using pre-ranked list of aberrantly expressed genes in all ISCC or all PSCC and positional gene sets available from MSigDB (http://www.broadinstitute.org/gsea/msigdb) according to previously published procedures [22].
SEMI	NEG	PMC5223343.xml	S134	Discussion	NEG	This seems to point to a great leap of significantly changed gene expression at or after the transition of PSCC to ISCC rather than a gradual change in gene expression that would match the previously described stepwise accumulation of chromosome instability in PSCC and ISCC.
SEMI	NEG	PMC5223343.xml	S153	Conclusions	NEG	Nevertheless, we were able to identify common patterns of aberrant transcription during squamous carcinogenesis by sorting genes according to their abnormal expression profiles in PSCC and ISCC and associate these genes with biological functions related to developing malignancies.
SEMI	NEG	PMC5223576.xml	S23	Background	NEG	Neutrophil-dominated airway inflammation of the CF lung environment is a well-established concept: bacterial pathogens interact with epithelial cells and alveolar macrophages, which are part of the lung’s innate cellular surveillance system, causing them to release pro-inflammatory mediators leading to excessive recruitment of neutrophils into the bronchoalveolar compartments of the lung [7, 8].
SEMI	NEG	PMC5223576.xml	S43	Methods	NEG	The use of lung tissue for scientific research was approved by the local ethics committee (S52174) and the biobankboard (S51577).
SEMI	NEG	PMC5223576.xml	S44	Methods	NEG	Patient data were collected via the electronic patient files or via the referring centre.
SEMI	NEG	PMC5223576.xml	S54	Methods	NEG	In the case of a HPF including both an airway and an accompanying blood vessel, only the cells in the immediate proximity of the airway were counted.
SEMI	NEG	PMC5223576.xml	S62	Methods	NEG	This resulted in the number of scattered cells and follicles being expressed as cells or follicles per mm2 area unit.
SEMI	NEG	PMC5223576.xml	S87	Results	NEG	There was no difference in the number of eosinophils between control and CF tissue, regardless whether we considered the whole sample or analysed per compartment (Table 2, Fig. 1).
SEMI	NEG	PMC5223576.xml	S100	Results	NEG	Both cytotoxic T cell (CD8) and CD4 T cell counts were significantly increased in CF tissue compared to controls (p < 0.001 and p = 0.007, respectively), whereas the slightly increased B cell counts in CF showed only a trend toward significance (p = 0.091 versus control) (Table 3, Fig. 2).
SEMI	NEG	PMC5223576.xml	S120	Discussion	NEG	The number of single B cells was not increased in the CF lung tissue.
SEMI	NEG	PMC5223576.xml	S124	Discussion	NEG	Lastly, lymphoid follicles had less B cells and more CD8 T cells in females.
SEMI	NEG	PMC5223576.xml	S126	Discussion	NEG	As more and more players involved in CF lung inflammation are being identified, it becomes increasingly clear how diverse and disturbed the inflammatory pattern really is.
SEMI	NEG	PMC5223576.xml	S145	Discussion	NEG	Given the lack of apparent differences in patient characteristics between male and female CF patients in our population which may account for the observed female predominance in airway inflammation, there is some room for speculation.
SEMI	NEG	PMC5223576.xml	S152	Discussion	NEG	The gender-based difference in inflammation in our CF population may be the result of overstimulation of Th17 activity by oestrogens similar to what is seen in autoimmune diseases.
SEMI	NEG	PMC5223576.xml	S156	Discussion	NEG	As there is a marked eosinophilic component, a more liberal policy with oral steroids (both during and independent of exacerbations) might be advocated in females.
SEMI	POS	PMC5223576.xml	S158	Discussion	POS	Although the comprehensive pathological analysis of end-stage CF lung tissue provided a valuable insight in the inflammatory diversity of this disease, our study has some limitations.
SEMI	POS	PMC5223576.xml	S159	Discussion	POS	The origin of our samples only allowed us to study end-stage disease.
SEMI	POS	PMC5223576.xml	S160	Discussion	POS	To visualize disease progression, earlier stages of the disease will need to be studied in a similar way.
SEMI	POS	PMC5223576.xml	S161	Discussion	POS	The study of Regamey et al. who used endobronchial biopsies of children with a median age of 7.3 years to investigate the inflammatory pattern in the bronchial mucosa, already suggested that the infiltrate predominantly consists of macrophages and lymphocytes [24].
SEMI	POS	PMC5223576.xml	S162	Discussion	POS	Although we did not specifically study the airway compartment when quantifying the lymphoid cells, it is clear that also in our study the CD4 and CD8 T cells outnumber the B cells, both as single dispersed cells as in the follicles, where in addition a composition shift to a larger proportion of CD4 T cells in CF compared to controls was noted.
SEMI	POS	PMC5223576.xml	S163	Discussion	POS	However, it seems that the lymphocytic infiltrate in the subepithelial tissue of children with CF has a larger portion of B cells (18% in CF compared to 13% in controls) which may indicate that the humoral adaptive response plays a bigger role in the earlier stages of CF lung disease.
SEMI	POS	PMC5223576.xml	S164	Discussion	POS	Moreover, Regamey et al. only found a limited number of neutrophils infiltrating the bronchial mucosa.
SEMI	POS	PMC5223576.xml	S165	Discussion	POS	The numerous presence of neutrophils around the airways in our study suggests that they infiltrate the tissue surrounding the airways in later stages of the disease, eventually leading to tissue destruction.
SEMI	POS	PMC5223576.xml	S166	Discussion	POS	A second limitation is that the number of CF and control tissue included is limited.
SEMI	POS	PMC5223576.xml	S167	Discussion	POS	As a result, we cannot exclude that the observed differences between male and female patients may be partly due to the small sample size.
SEMI	POS	PMC5223576.xml	S168	Discussion	POS	Thirdly, due to the large surface area of the biopsies and the fragile nature of CF lung tissue, we chose to cut nine μm thick sections.
SEMI	POS	PMC5223576.xml	S169	Discussion	POS	This could however confound our results in two ways: it may increase all cell type counts in CF tissue compared with controls, and it may also increase the number of large cell types like macrophages and neutrophils compared with small cells.
SEMI	POS	PMC5223576.xml	S170	Discussion	POS	Therefore, we described our findings in a qualitative way, not elaborating on the extent of the quantitative difference between CF and controls.
SEMI	POS	PMC5223576.xml	S171	Discussion	POS	Moreover, we have not compared cell types to each other but only looked at the differences between groups.
SEMI	POS	PMC5223576.xml	S172	Discussion	POS	A last limitation of our study is the age discrepancy between CF patients and control subjects, due to the fact that transplanted CF patients at our centre are inevitably younger than patients undergoing resection of bronchial carcinoma or in whom lung tissue was obtained after autopsy.
SEMI	NEG	PMC5223576.xml	S176	Conclusion	NEG	Together with the elevated presence of single T cells and macrophages in CF tissue, this may suggest a role for the cellular adaptive immune system in the pathophysiology of CF.
SEMI	NEG	PMC5223576.xml	S178	Conclusion	NEG	This may be the result of the complex immunomodulatory effects of oestrogen on inflammation.
SEMI	NEG	PMC5225233.xml	S7		NEG	The secondary outcome was hospital readmission within 30 days of surgery.
SEMI	NEG	PMC5225233.xml	S38		NEG	Results of the study will be disseminated to migraine patients’ organizations.
SEMI	NEG	PMC5225233.xml	S58		NEG	We examined the robustness of our results in several a priori planned sensitivity analyses.
SEMI	POS	PMC5225233.xml	S129		POS	Several limitations have to be considered when interpreting our results.
SEMI	POS	PMC5225233.xml	S130		POS	Firstly, our classification of migraine and migraine aura was based on ICD-9 codes using the Partners Healthcare Research Patients Data Registry dataset, which may lead to misclassification.31
SEMI	POS	PMC5225233.xml	S131		POS	ICD-9 codes are perhaps the most commonly used classification scheme in perioperative epidemiologic research.
SEMI	POS	PMC5225233.xml	S132		POS	The generation of these codes is undoubtedly susceptible to error at several different points along the path from admission of the patient to inclusion into a database, but the level of accuracy may be less important than the pattern of error.
SEMI	POS	PMC5225233.xml	S133		POS	If random or non-differential misclassification exists, it is unlikely to cause the observed association.32
SEMI	POS	PMC5225233.xml	S134		POS	In addition, the ICD-9 codes for migraine reported in our study correspond to reported data on prevalence of migraine in the general population,1 which is a reassuring finding.
SEMI	POS	PMC5225233.xml	S135		POS	Although we made efforts to account for potential misclassification of headache type in our study (see supplementary appendix), doctors may not always record a diagnosis of migraine for mild cases or may incorrectly label them as a different type of headache.
SEMI	POS	PMC5225233.xml	S136		POS	The available ICD-9 codes for migraine and migraine aura could capture a subgroup of patients with migraine with the most active, bothersome aura, which may represent a subgroup at higher risk for perioperative ischemic stroke.
SEMI	NEG	PMC5225233.xml	S142		NEG	Our findings were robust when we adjusted for transient ischemic attacks that can be clinically misinterpreted as migraine aura (see supplementary appendix).
SEMI	NEG	PMC5225233.xml	S146		NEG	Previous reports suggest that the migraine-ischemic stroke association is highest or only observable among patients with low vascular risk status (such as low Framingham scores or absence of hypertension, diabetes, or myocardial infarction).3 5 28
SEMI	NEG	PMC5225233.xml	S155		NEG	In contrast, perioperative stroke rates have been shown to increase greatly with patients’ age.17
SEMI	NEG	PMC5225233.xml	S198		NEG	The use of high dose vasopressors during surgery may be an indicator of suboptimal preload and possibly decreased cardiac output, which can further lead to an impairment of cerebral oxygenation despite normalization of mean arterial blood pressure.61 62
SEMI	NEG	PMC5225233.xml	S199		NEG	Meticulous optimization of fluid resuscitation volume during anesthesia and surgery should help to avoid excessive use of vasopressors and its associated increased vulnerability to perioperative stroke.
SEMI	NEG	PMC5225236.xml	S33		NEG	The intervention program was modeled on recent experience in the UK15 and included government supported industry agreements to reduce sodium in processed foods, government monitoring of industry compliance, and a public health campaign targeting consumer choices.
SEMI	NEG	PMC5225236.xml	S46		NEG	First, this cost is most relevant to budget constrained governments, since the program cost must be borne directly and immediately.
SEMI	NEG	PMC5225236.xml	S49		NEG	Third, in contrast to recent US models,10 11 we did not include estimated healthcare savings or increased productivity from prevented cardiovascular disease events because such savings could, in theory, be partly offset by new downstream health events resulting from enhanced survival18 19 and because comparable healthcare and productivity costing data are available for a minority of countries globally.
SEMI	NEG	PMC5225236.xml	S76		NEG	To quantify statistical uncertainty, we used probabilistic sensitivity analyses based on 1000 Monte Carlo simulations to derive 95% uncertainty intervals, with varying inputs for sodium use, blood pressure levels, effects of sodium on blood pressure, and effects of blood pressure on cardiovascular disease (see supplementary eMethods).
SEMI	NEG	PMC5225236.xml	S104		NEG	Eleven nations, all small, had estimated cost effectiveness ratios between I$10 000 and I$30 000/DALY (see supplementary eTable 3).
SEMI	NEG	PMC5225236.xml	S121		NEG	We also made comparisons against a cost effectiveness ratio benchmark <0.5×GDP per capita, still substantially below the WHO criterion of 1×GDP per capita as highly cost effective.
SEMI	NEG	PMC5225236.xml	S136		NEG	Thus, there are meaningful “returns to scale” on both the cost side and the effect side.
SEMI	NEG	PMC5225236.xml	S141		NEG	Some analyses further accounted for productivity gains from reduced morbidity and mortality from cardiovascular disease, further increasing cost savings.
SEMI	NEG	PMC5225236.xml	S147		NEG	Additionally, our analysis of 183 countries using consistent methods enabled us to explore sources of heterogeneity and sensitivity in estimated cost effectiveness across diverse nations and regions.
SEMI	NEG	PMC5225236.xml	S149		NEG	Differences in intervention costs were one of the major drivers of varying cost effectiveness ratios.
SEMI	NEG	PMC5225236.xml	S156		NEG	In nations with lower proportions of manufactured food, industry focused efforts might lead to smaller absolute reductions in sodium intake.
SEMI	NEG	PMC5225236.xml	S157		NEG	Yet many such countries also have lower baseline levels of sodium consumption,1 so that proportional reductions might be similar.
SEMI	NEG	PMC5225236.xml	S160		NEG	Our findings were robust to differing thresholds for optimal sodium intake.
SEMI	NEG	PMC5225236.xml	S169		NEG	The cost estimates incorporated country specific demographic, economic, and health data, together with results from cross country non-traded input price regressions, to produce credible estimates of national prices.
SEMI	POS	PMC5225236.xml	S171		POS	Potential limitations should be considered.
SEMI	POS	PMC5225236.xml	S172		POS	The estimates of sodium consumption, blood pressure levels, and rates of cardiovascular disease were based on raw data covering most but not all of the global population, with hierarchical estimation of the remainder.1 39 40
SEMI	POS	PMC5225236.xml	S173		POS	Our estimates of health benefits accounted only for cardiovascular disease, whereas high sodium intake is also associated with vascular stiffness, renal dysfunction, and stomach cancer, independent of blood pressure levels.41 42 43
SEMI	POS	PMC5225236.xml	S174		POS	We did not account for possible unintended consequences of the intervention, such as changes in population choices of overall foods consumed.
SEMI	POS	PMC5225236.xml	S175		POS	We did not model health system savings from averted cardiovascular disease events.
SEMI	POS	PMC5225236.xml	S176		POS	Better cardiovascular health may produce compression of disease and costs into the last years of life, reducing overall morbidity and lifetime costs, but modeling such potential health transitions and treatment costs for every nation globally is not yet feasible.
SEMI	POS	PMC5225236.xml	S177		POS	We did not evaluate potential effects on disparities within countries; for instance, food product reformulation to reduce sodium intake in England has been estimated to reduce socioeconomic inequalities in cardiovascular disease.44
SEMI	POS	PMC5225236.xml	S178		POS	Our models are based on a 10 year intervention period including planning, development, and staged implementation.
SEMI	POS	PMC5225236.xml	S179		POS	Over the longer term, intervention costs may decrease, while lifetime health benefits might also increase.
SEMI	POS	PMC5225236.xml	S180		POS	Thus, these findings should be considered a platform on which to base intermediate term policies, recognizing that longer term effectiveness should also be evaluated.
SEMI	POS	PMC5225236.xml	S181		POS	Our assumptions about intervention implementation may differ in various real world situations, producing larger or smaller costs and effect sizes.
SEMI	POS	PMC5225236.xml	S182		POS	However, our analyses of the sensitivity of our findings to variations in costs and effectiveness demonstrated that overall cost effectiveness was highly robust to alternative assumptions.
SEMI	POS	PMC5225236.xml	S183		POS	We did not evaluate other potential strategies to reduce sodium intake, such as mandatory quality standards, taxation, complementary state or community initiatives, or multi-component approaches, such as seen in Japan and Finland.45 46 47
SEMI	POS	PMC5225236.xml	S184		POS	These might produce similar or even greater reductions in sodium intake at less cost, but are also perhaps less feasible in certain nations.

SEMI	NEG	PMC5225517.xml	S26	Background	NEG	Since LABAs and LAMAs have different mechanisms of action, they may exert additive bronchodilation effects when used together.
SEMI	NEG	PMC5225517.xml	S51	Methods	NEG	The per-protocol (PP) population consisted of all patients in the ITT population without major protocol violations or who discontinued the study due to treatment-related reasons.

SEMI	NEG	PMC5228538.xml	S9		NEG	For participants randomised to five years of OPUS treatment, the treatment was largely unchanged.
SEMI	NEG	PMC5228538.xml	S49		NEG	Randomisation was stratified according to treatment site and negative symptoms.
SEMI	NEG	PMC5228538.xml	S51		NEG	The full study protocol is published elsewhere.21
SEMI	NEG	PMC5228538.xml	S73		NEG	Participants in both intervention groups were treated in accordance with national and regional guidelines recommending low doses of antipsychotic drugs in monotherapy for patients with first episode schizophrenia spectrum disorder and second generation antipsychotic drugs as first line of treatment.26 27
SEMI	NEG	PMC5228538.xml	S82		NEG	Thus, all questions regarding the treatment were presented in self-rated questionnaires.
SEMI	NEG	PMC5228538.xml	S119		NEG	The total score of the personal and social performance scale is reported.
SEMI	NEG	PMC5228538.xml	S129		NEG	All investigators were trained in conducting interviews for the schedule for clinical assessment in neuropsychiatry at the Copenhagen University’s PhD course.
SEMI	NEG	PMC5228538.xml	S130		NEG	Similarly, all investigators were trained in manuals for the scale for assessment for positive symptoms and scale for assessment of negative symptoms, and there were regular reliability interviews at the baseline investigations and during follow-up.
SEMI	NEG	PMC5228538.xml	S162		NEG	Of the 400 patients included, 289 were seen at the follow-up interview.
SEMI	NEG	PMC5228538.xml	S193		NEG	The lack of treatment benefits of the prolonged treatment could either be interpreted to mean that the beneficial effects of two years of treatment can be sustained without needing further SEI treatment, or that three additional years of treatment do not improve the outcome of illness.
SEMI	NEG	PMC5228538.xml	S204		NEG	We were aware that some patients were on waiting lists in the community health centres for up to one year before starting their OPUS treatment.
SEMI	NEG	PMC5228538.xml	S208		NEG	There are various explanations for the effects seen on the working alliance and client satisfaction questionnaire, which indicates a more positive patient experience.
SEMI	POS	PMC5228538.xml	S216		POS	Owing to the nature of psychosocial interventions, participants and clinical staff were not blinded.
SEMI	POS	PMC5228538.xml	S217		POS	The primary outcome was negative symptoms, but because the study included participants with non-psychotic disorder (schizotypal disorder), it was underpowered to detect small differences on the psychotic dimension.
SEMI	POS	PMC5228538.xml	S218		POS	Furthermore, the need to randomise patients six months before the start of the intervention could have affected the last part of the OPUS treatment for the treatment as usual group.
SEMI	POS	PMC5228538.xml	S219		POS	Of 468 participants eligible for inclusion in the study, 11 were transferred to specialist teams such as a dual diagnosis team or forensic team, or lived in supported housing facilities with a high staff-to-patient ratio and therefore did not continue in OPUS treatment.
SEMI	POS	PMC5228538.xml	S220		POS	Another 23 eligible participants declined to participate, and we do not know how these two groups differed from the studied population.
SEMI	POS	PMC5228538.xml	S221		POS	Follow-up was 72%, which was sufficient, but there was substantial attrition bias with regard to treatment site, negative and disorganised dimension, diagnosis, and client satisfaction.
SEMI	POS	PMC5228538.xml	S222		POS	We corrected these differences by using multiple imputations, setting the number of imputations as high as 100, and calculating sensitivity analyses for the missing data.
SEMI	POS	PMC5228538.xml	S223		POS	However, we do not know whether the results would have changed without this attrition.
SEMI	POS	PMC5228538.xml	S224		POS	We have no measurement of family or carers’ experience of the intervention, and we believe that inclusion of their experiences would have provided valuable information.
SEMI	POS	PMC5228538.xml	S225		POS	No measurement of fidelity was included in the study which makes us unable to report on the treatment actually provided in the study period, neither were we able to thoroughly assess the treatment provided to the treatment as usual group.
SEMI	POS	PMC5228538.xml	S226		POS	Adherence to treatment was only measured at the end of the study and therefore was not a fully adequate measurement during follow-up.
SEMI	POS	PMC5228538.xml	S227		POS	To assess the use of outpatient services, we found the use of registers an inaccurate method to assess adherence during follow-up, and therefore supplemented our register data with registrations from the medical files for the last three months of follow-up.
SEMI	POS	PMC5228538.xml	S228		POS	We abstained from using any measurements of adherence in the follow-up interview because of the risk of breaking the blind.
SEMI	POS	PMC5228538.xml	S229		POS	Finally, the reliance on only two time points restricted our ability to analyse the course of illness.
SEMI	POS	PMC5228538.xml	S230		POS	We chose only one follow-up point owing to previous problems with high attrition rates with frequent follow-up points.
SEMI	POS	PMC5228538.xml	S231		POS	To compensate for this, we supplemented our survey data with register data, which to some degree can be used to analyse the entire follow-up period.
SEMI	NEG	PMC5228538.xml	S233		NEG	To our knowledge, this is the first randomised clinical trial testing prolonged early intervention beyond three years.
SEMI	NEG	PMC5228538.xml	S235		NEG	Therefore, the treatment offered in the treatment as usual group might not be comparable to the service level in Denmark.

SEMI	POS	PMC5228641.xml	S210	Discussion	POS	The second limitation is that only male inmates took part in the current study.
SEMI	POS	PMC5228641.xml	S211	Discussion	POS	It may be that different outcomes would result with female prisoners or mixed groups.

SEMI	NEG	PMC5228648.xml	S118	Discussion	NEG	Since the mean age was around 67 to 69 years in the present study, it could be supposed that most of these women were menopausal,[24] but this specific factor was not examined in the present study.
SEMI	POS	PMC5228648.xml	S125	Discussion	POS	The present study is not without limitations.
SEMI	POS	PMC5228648.xml	S126	Discussion	POS	First, it was from a single hospital and only involved patients who were managed by cardiologists.

SEMI	POS	PMC5228648.xml	S128	Discussion	POS	Second, because of the retrospective nature of the study, some data were not available.
SEMI	POS	PMC5228648.xml	S129	Discussion	POS	Menopause has a strong influence on the CAD risk in women, but it was not collected.
SEMI	POS	PMC5228648.xml	S130	Discussion	POS	The exact dose of statin was not collected either, which constitutes a major limitation.
SEMI	POS	PMC5228648.xml	S131	Discussion	POS	Third, only patients who had complete lipid profile data were included.
SEMI	POS	PMC5228648.xml	S132	Discussion	POS	Patients without recent lipid profiles could be more likely to be undertreated, and the present study may have underestimated the actual number of patients who are achieving their lipid goals in clinical practice.

SEMI	POS	PMC5228648.xml	S134	Discussion	POS	Finally, the patients were followed up for 1 year only, preventing the observation of the long-term effects of statin therapy after PCI, as well as the prognosis of the patients.
SEMI	POS	PMC5228648.xml	S135	Discussion	POS	The results of the present study need to be confirmed by multicenter studies and larger sample size.

SEMI	NEG	PMC5228649.xml	S121	Results	NEG	When CV events were further divided into myocardial infarction, HF, and sudden cardiac death, PVC > 12/day was associated with HF and sudden cardiac death.
SEMI	NEG	PMC5228649.xml	S134	Discussion	NEG	However, one of the limitations of these studies was the use of the 2-minute ECG “rhythm strip,” the 12-second ECG, the 30-second ECG, and the 1-hour ECG which may not have been long enough to identify patients with low frequency PVCs.
SEMI	NEG	PMC5228649.xml	S157	Discussion	NEG	High PVC burden has been shown to predispose to left ventricular dysfunction in previous studies.[11,12,28,29,35]

SEMI	NEG	PMC5228656.xml	S76	Discussion	NEG	This finding indirectly supported the hypothesis that obliterative angiopathy involving small vessels might be the pathogenesis in both retinal and neurological disorders in CRMCC.[2,4–6]
SEMI	NEG	PMC5228656.xml	S77	Discussion	NEG	Therefore, gradient-echo imaging (T2∗-weighted imaging or susceptibility weighted imaging), which was used for detecting cerebral micro hemorrhages, may be an essential tool for diagnosis.

SEMI	NEG	PMC5228662.xml	S25	Methods	NEG	A leukomalactic lesion was observed in the left cerebellum on brain magnetic resonance imaging taken at 3 weeks after onset, however, no abnormal lesion was observed in the midbrain (Fig. 1A).
SEMI	NEG	PMC5228663.xml	S21	Introduction	NEG	Better understanding of the molecular mechanism of PC is beneficial for development of novel therapeutic targets.
SEMI	NEG	PMC5228663.xml	S72	Materials and methods	NEG	Thereafter, the target genes co-regulated by the top 30 DEmiRNA pairs were put through GO BP functional enrichment analysis by clusterProfiler package in R (available at http://bioconductor.org/packages/release/bioc/html/clusterProfiler.html, version: 2.0.0),[24] and the criteria for significant BP terms were P < 0.05 and q < 0.05.
SEMI	NEG	PMC5228663.xml	S99	Results	NEG	Apparently, hsa-miR-1184, hsa-miR-1207-5p, and hsa-miR-24 had significant functional synergistic relationships.
SEMI	NEG	PMC5228663.xml	S154	Discussion	NEG	In this study, COX2 is co-regulated by both up-regulated and down-regulated DEmiRNAs, like hsa-miR-490-5p, hsa-miR-509-3-5p, hsa-miR-143, hsa-miR-628-3p, hsa-miR-182, and hsa-miR-183, indicating that the balance between these DEmiRNAs might play a role in PC through co-regulating COX2.
SEMI	NEG	PMC5228664.xml	S20	Introduction	NEG	Death caused by AVN contusion following blunt chest trauma and trauma to the vulnerable locations surrounding an AVN contusion have not been reported so far.
SEMI	NEG	PMC5228664.xml	S55	Clinical Findings	NEG	In addition, toxicology screening was negative for common drugs and alcohol.
SEMI	NEG	PMC5228664.xml	S121	Discussion	NEG	It was worth noting that the reported cases all suffered from blunt impact to the chest and hemorrhages were seen between the RA and left atrium on the posterior aspect and at the base of the heart.
SEMI	NEG	PMC5228664.xml	S123	Discussion	NEG	Eventually, the victims were deemed to have died due to arrhythmia and cardiac arrest induced by the AVN contusions.
SEMI	NEG	PMC5228665.xml	S12	Abstract	NEG	There was no improvement of spinal cord function with conservative measures, and he required a wheelchair for movement.
SEMI	NEG	PMC5228665.xml	S33	Introduction	NEG	The vertebral column resection (VCR) technique may provide an effective option to correct these severe and rigid spinal deformities with limited flexibility.
SEMI	NEG	PMC5228665.xml	S51	Case report	NEG	However, the deformity gradually progressed over the years.
SEMI	NEG	PMC5228665.xml	S111	Discussion	NEG	Longer follow-up is warranted to assess postoperative clinical and radiographic results.
SEMI	NEG	PMC5228666.xml	S57		NEG	During hospitalization, all patients’ vital sign, laboratory results, and general condition were investigated.
SEMI	NEG	PMC5228666.xml	S128		NEG	Among them, GemCap was identified as an alternative combination therapy for patients with advanced pancreatic cancer.[19,20]
SEMI	NEG	PMC5228666.xml	S146		NEG	Unfortunately, it decreases the value and novelty of the results from the current study.
SEMI	NEG	PMC5228666.xml	S151		NEG	In conclusion, this study was the first phase III study conducted in Asian patients using GemCap combination therapy.
SEMI	NEG	PMC5228667.xml	S8	Abstract	NEG	All scales were converted to 0 to 100 (higher scores are better).
SEMI	NEG	PMC5228667.xml	S13	Abstract	NEG	For social climate and vitality, this corresponded to moderate effect sizes (Cohen d = 0.51 for both) in favor of physical exercise.
SEMI	NEG	PMC5228667.xml	S25	Introduction	NEG	In the workplace setting, physical exercise in terms of strength training together with colleagues effectively reduces musculoskeletal pain symptoms and improves physical capacity.[14–18]
SEMI	NEG	PMC5228667.xml	S43	Methods	NEG	At baseline before randomization and at 10-week follow-up, participants replied to a questionnaire concerning work, health, social climate, mental health, and vitality.
SEMI	NEG	PMC5228667.xml	S58	Methods	NEG	The study was approved by The Danish National Ethics Committee on Biomedical Research (Ethical committee of Frederiksberg and Copenhagen; H-3-2010-062) and registered in ClinicalTrials.gov (NCT01671267) before enrollment of participants.
SEMI	NEG	PMC5228667.xml	S83	Methods	NEG	The questions were phrased “How would you describe the social climate at your workplace….” competitive, encouraging and supportive, distrustful and suspicious, relaxed and comfortable, rigid and rule based, and conflict laden.
SEMI	NEG	PMC5228667.xml	S100	Methods	NEG	The estimation method was restricted maximum likelihood with degrees of freedom based on the Satterthwaite approximation.
SEMI	NEG	PMC5228667.xml	S106	Methods	NEG	Finally, simple associations between single variables were tested by calculating Spearman rank correlation coefficient (rho).
SEMI	NEG	PMC5228667.xml	S112	Results	NEG	At baseline, the mean scores of social climate, mental health, and vitality were 52.2 (SD 14.9), 79.5 (SD 13.7), 53.9 (SD 19.7), respectively, in the total study sample (n = 66).
SEMI	NEG	PMC5228667.xml	S134	Discussion	NEG	The present results concur with our previous finding that group-based strength training improves working relationships within teams among nurses at hospitals.[20]
SEMI	POS	PMC5228667.xml	S153	Discussion	POS	Our study has both strengths and limitations.
SEMI	POS	PMC5228667.xml	S154	Discussion	POS	A strength of the present analyses is that the intervention activities did not specifically focus on psychosocial factors.
SEMI	POS	PMC5228667.xml	S155	Discussion	POS	Thus, placebo effects and expectation bias—which is common for perceptions of pain in interventions focusing on pain reduction[34]—is unlikely to have occurred for the present psychosocial outcomes.
SEMI	POS	PMC5228667.xml	S156	Discussion	POS	In addition, the parallel-group, examiner-blinded, randomized controlled trial design with allocation concealment protects against a number of biases.[21]
SEMI	POS	PMC5228667.xml	S157	Discussion	POS	For example, seasonal variations are known to influence perceived health and wellbeing, that is, work ability, pain symptoms, and psychosocial factors worsen during the winter.[35–39]
SEMI	POS	PMC5228667.xml	S158	Discussion	POS	Because the present study was carried out from summer (baseline) to winter (follow-up), a general worsening of the psychosocial factors would be expected.
SEMI	POS	PMC5228667.xml	S159	Discussion	POS	However, comparing the results of the physical exercise group with the reference group—that is, between-group differences from baseline to follow-up using the linear mixed model—effectively eliminates the influence of seasonal variation for the interpretation of the effectiveness of the physical exercise intervention.
SEMI	POS	PMC5228667.xml	S160	Discussion	POS	A limitation is that the present analyses should be considered exploratory in nature.
SEMI	POS	PMC5228667.xml	S161	Discussion	POS	Thus, we did not have a predefined hypothesis about physical exercise being able to improve the psychosocial factors of this study.
SEMI	POS	PMC5228667.xml	S162	Discussion	POS	However, this may also be considered a strength of the study because preconceived beliefs are unlikely to have influenced researchers and participants for these specific outcomes.
SEMI	NEG	PMC5228668.xml	S26		NEG	Aerial perspective, however, is a source of visual error in judging the distances and speeds of far objects in natural settings.[24–26]
SEMI	NEG	PMC5228668.xml	S70		NEG	Our study, therefore, examined the circumstances of the crash and focused on each location at 3 moments.
SEMI	NEG	PMC5228668.xml	S96		NEG	Bright sunlight was present in about one-third of daytime crashes and similarly frequent regardless of whether the crash location was exact or inexact.
SEMI	NEG	PMC5228668.xml	S110		NEG	The largest increased crash risk was for patients who died (n = 707) and showed a 32% increase associated with bright sunlight (95% confidence interval: 13–55).
SEMI	NEG	PMC5228669.xml	S26	Introduction	NEG	Such excessive blood loss may cause severe hypotension, metabolic acidosis, infections, acute lung injury, and cardiac arrest.[6,8,9]
SEMI	NEG	PMC5228669.xml	S28	Introduction	NEG	Recently, a number of studies demonstrated that TA can efficiently decrease the perioperative blood loss and transfusion.[9,11–17]
SEMI	NEG	PMC5228669.xml	S48	Materials and methods	NEG	(2) History of bleeding disorders or thromboembolic events.
SEMI	NEG	PMC5228669.xml	S94	Materials and methods	NEG	The iliac crest bone was not used for grafting.
SEMI	NEG	PMC5228669.xml	S100	Materials and methods	NEG	The intraoperative estimated blood loss was estimated by a trained nurse before starting the trial and was blinded to the treatment and patient groups.
SEMI	NEG	PMC5228669.xml	S106	Materials and methods	NEG	When the postoperative Hb level was <70 g/L, 7.0 to10.0 g/dL and patients exhibited symptomatic anemia, such as tachycardia, fatigue, lethargy, poor appetite, and pallor, packed red blood cells were administered.
SEMI	NEG	PMC5228669.xml	S126	Results	NEG	These patients presented lumbar spinal stenosis or lumbar spondylolisthesis and were undergoing posterior decompression interbody fusion fixation with the pedicle screw.
SEMI	NEG	PMC5228669.xml	S188	Discussion	NEG	and a maintenance dosage of 2 mg/kg/h TA, Elwatidy et al[25] had a similar result to our study.
SEMI	NEG	PMC5228669.xml	S189	Discussion	NEG	So our study maybe partly support that the high dose of TA have better effect than the low dose of TA in spinal surgeries.
SEMI	NEG	PMC5228669.xml	S196	Discussion	NEG	All patients were followed-up for more than 35 days after the operation.
SEMI	NEG	PMC5228669.xml	S199	Discussion	NEG	Several studies have confirmed that TA does not increase the risk of deep vein thrombosis and pulmonary embolism.[8,9,11–16,19]
SEMI	NEG	PMC5228669.xml	S201	Discussion	NEG	Any complications associated with TA, such as allergic reaction, stroke, ischemic heart disease, and dysfunction of liver and kidney, also did not occur.
SEMI	POS	PMC5228669.xml	S203	Discussion	POS	However, the present study conferred some limitations.
SEMI	POS	PMC5228669.xml	S204	Discussion	POS	Due to more than 50% patients belonging to the population with low difficulty surgeries, the effect of the test for patients with the difficulty of level II and III would be lessened.
SEMI	POS	PMC5228669.xml	S205	Discussion	POS	We carried out a subgroup analysis based on the level of difficulty.
SEMI	POS	PMC5228669.xml	S206	Discussion	POS	Patients with only the difficulty levels II and III did not show any statistical difference between the 2 groups in intraoperative estimated blood loss, the reduction trend was visible (less 26%); the total blood loss in the TA group was significantly less than the placebo group (Table 7), which is in agreement with the previous studies.[15,18]
SEMI	POS	PMC5228669.xml	S207	Discussion	POS	Nevertheless, future studies would be designed to adequately decrease the number of patients with difficulty level I, and increase the population of level II and III.
SEMI	POS	PMC5228669.xml	S208	Discussion	POS	The second limitation was single dose treatment regimen, as the optimal dose regimen in this kind of spinal surgery is not known.
SEMI	POS	PMC5228669.xml	S209	Discussion	POS	A simultaneous efficacy comparison of different dose regimens of TA will also be investigated.
SEMI	POS	PMC5228669.xml	S210	Discussion	POS	The third limitation was that there were 2 surgeons included in our study.
SEMI	POS	PMC5228669.xml	S211	Discussion	POS	Some documents reported that surgeons may be a potential factor affecting the amount of bleeding during the perioperative period.
SEMI	POS	PMC5228669.xml	S212	Discussion	POS	However, the operative time, intraoperative estimated blood loss, and total blood loss were not statistically different and the correlation analysis showed the surgeons were not significant factor for total blood loss.
SEMI	POS	PMC5228669.xml	S213	Discussion	POS	The significance of surgeons’ effects may be minimal, given the fact the patients were equally distributed in both groups, and the surgeons equally taken part in surgeries between the groups, as well as all procedures were similarly performed in the same institution.
SEMI	POS	PMC5228669.xml	S214	Discussion	POS	The present study agrees with the previous documents.[13,14,25]
SEMI	NEG	PMC5228670.xml	S19	Case report	NEG	A 65-year-old male underwent a right radical nephrectomy 10 years ago, and the postoperative pathologic examination revealed renal clear cell carcinoma (RCCC).
SEMI	NEG	PMC5228670.xml	S23	Case report	NEG	Since then, he received an electronic colonoscopy every 1 to 2 years until the year 2016, when a protruded lesion was found in his rectum.
SEMI	NEG	PMC5228670.xml	S45	Discussion	NEG	These rare metastatic sites were usually accompanied by multiple metastasis in the whole body, and the period from the initial diagnosis of RCC to metastasis may range from several years to more than 10 years.
SEMI	NEG	PMC5228670.xml	S57	Discussion	NEG	In this report, FDG-PET/CT images of metastatic RCC in rectum showed hypermetabolic activity in upper rectum with an average SUV of 5.0 and SUVmax of 10.0, which was a relatively high level.
SEMI	NEG	PMC5228671.xml	S44	Case report	NEG	The results of laboratory tests showed elevated inflammatory markers, and details were shown in Table 1.
SEMI	NEG	PMC5228671.xml	S46	Case report	NEG	Oral corticosteroid therapy (prednisone 15 mg qd) was introduced for 2 months.
SEMI	NEG	PMC5228671.xml	S71	Discussion	NEG	Hence, we could not determine whether our patient was with spinal involvement in SAPHO syndrome or not.
SEMI	NEG	PMC5228671.xml	S81	Discussion	NEG	In another study, anti-CCP antibody was negative in all the 69 patients tested.[14,15]
SEMI	NEG	PMC5228672.xml	S5	Abstract	NEG	Interpreting individual results relies on accurate reference intervals and decision limits.
SEMI	NEG	PMC5228672.xml	S32	Background	NEG	Although elderly persons sometimes are regarded as elderly versions of adults, from a physiopathological viewpoint, seniors—analogously to children—have their distinct own biology.
SEMI	NEG	PMC5228672.xml	S36	Background	NEG	Although the majority of health care resources are spent on the elderly, reference ranges for the elderly are scarce.
SEMI	NEG	PMC5228672.xml	S54	Background	NEG	This additional methodological strength of the SENIORLAB study is unprecedented and has the potential of modifying the theory of constructing reference intervals within the senior citizen community.
SEMI	NEG	PMC5228672.xml	S91	Methods/design	NEG	Furthermore, a personal history of diseases and surgical procedures, as well as intake of drugs and supplements, was recorded.
SEMI	NEG	PMC5228672.xml	S96	Methods/design	NEG	The investigators will have access to the final dataset.
SEMI	NEG	PMC5228672.xml	S114	Methods/design	NEG	This number allows for determination of the 90% confidence interval of the upper and lower reference limits.
SEMI	NEG	PMC5228672.xml	S124	Methods/design	NEG	Clinicopathological measurements were conducted immediately after drawing the blood samples to provide optimal preanalytical conditions.
SEMI	NEG	PMC5228672.xml	S136	Methods/design	NEG	For all other analyses, statistical comparisons will be performed by t test/Mann–Whitney U test, χ2 or Fisher exact test; tests for trend; or analysis of variance/Kruskal–Wallis test, as indicated by the specific statistical problem.
SEMI	POS	PMC5228672.xml	S155	Discussion	POS	The SENIORLAB study possesses strengths and limitations.
SEMI	POS	PMC5228672.xml	S156	Discussion	POS	Regarding the primary aim of reference interval determination, internal validity is hampered by the fact that biological variation was not considered because, in most individuals, only 1 blood sample was obtained per participant and only a minority of participants provided 2 blood samples.[39]
SEMI	POS	PMC5228672.xml	S157	Discussion	POS	As a consequence, the study cannot assess a preference of population-based reference intervals over intraindividual reference changing values.[7]
SEMI	POS	PMC5228672.xml	S158	Discussion	POS	External validity is impaired by the fact that the investigated cohort consists entirely of participants with Caucasian descent.
SEMI	POS	PMC5228672.xml	S159	Discussion	POS	As a consequence, the evaluated reference intervals might not be extrapolated to persons with other racial backgrounds.
SEMI	POS	PMC5228672.xml	S160	Discussion	POS	Furthermore, the term of a subjectively healthy well-being is debatable and might also impair extrapolation to other groups.
SEMI	POS	PMC5228672.xml	S161	Discussion	POS	We intentionally chose a nonrestrictive definition of health, which in our view is closer to the majority of elderly persons.
SEMI	POS	PMC5228672.xml	S162	Discussion	POS	Absence of disease or medication is the elderly is relatively rare.
SEMI	POS	PMC5228672.xml	S163	Discussion	POS	For example, normal blood pressure is encountered in only 7% of persons aged ≥80 years.[40]
SEMI	POS	PMC5228672.xml	S164	Discussion	POS	Furthermore, medication use in the elderly occurs very frequently, and surveys have shown that up to 80% in the age group of >65 years reported having ingested at least 1 drug during the past week.[41]
SEMI	NEG	PMC5228672.xml	S167	Discussion	NEG	Based on the difficulties in performing a clear-cut objective differentiation of health from disease in the elderly, we are convinced that long-term life expectancy in addition to perception of subjective health is a robust and suitable additive criterion to select individuals for the evaluation of reference intervals.
SEMI	NEG	PMC5228673.xml	S6	Abstract	NEG	Parametric image of distribution volume ratio (DVR) for each participant was generated by applying a relative equilibrium-based graphical analysis.
SEMI	NEG	PMC5228673.xml	S99	Methods	NEG	Regional average DVR of [11C]-(R)-PK11195 were assessed using a Student 2-tailed t test.
SEMI	NEG	PMC5228673.xml	S132	Discussion	NEG	The microglia play key roles in both neuropathic pain and neurodegenerative diseases, and can respond to proinflammatory signals released from other non-neuronal cells.[38]
SEMI	NEG	PMC5228673.xml	S133	Discussion	NEG	Microglial production of proinflammatory cytokines can further recruit microglia and promote the sensitization of CNS nociceptive circuits.[39]
SEMI	NEG	PMC5228674.xml	S33		NEG	The stent in the D2 was re-wired through the proximal/middle stent cell of the stent in the LAD artery (Fig. 1, D6).
SEMI	NEG	PMC5228674.xml	S34		NEG	Kissing balloon was performed using a 2.75 × 12 mm and 3.0 × 12 mm noncompliant balloons at 10 atm (Fig. 1, D7), and then proximal optimization technique was conducted with a 3.5 × 9 mm noncompliant balloon (Fig. 1, D8 and D9).
SEMI	NEG	PMC5228674.xml	S49		NEG	The 1-year follow-up imaging data demonstrated complete struts coverage even in segments with 3 layers of struts, and no evidence of instent restenosis.
SEMI	NEG	PMC5228674.xml	S52		NEG	Moreover, poststenting OCT imaging provides unique information for further optimal treatment strategy.
SEMI	NEG	PMC5228675.xml	S68	Methods	NEG	For instance, the 3-year CDFS estimate for patients who had already been disease free for 1 year was computed by dividing the 4-year CuDFS by the 1-year CuDFS, which is summarized as CDFS3 = CuDFS(x+3)/CuDFS(x).
SEMI	NEG	PMC5228675.xml	S74	Results	NEG	Seventy-five percent of the patients were ER positive, whereas 70% of the patients were PgR positive.
SEMI	NEG	PMC5228675.xml	S78	Results	NEG	At year 0 (baseline), positive lymphovascular invasion (LVI), Ki-67 labelling index ≥14%, high pathologic primary tumor (pT) stage, and high pathologic regional lymph node (pN) stage were risk factors.
SEMI	NEG	PMC5228675.xml	S118	Discussion	NEG	As expected, the 3-year CDFS rates for HER2-positive and triple-negative patients were similar to the rate for the HR-negative group, and the CDFS rates were similar between the luminal A subtype and luminal B subtype patients and the HR-positive patients.
SEMI	NEG	PMC5228676.xml	S9	Abstract	NEG	We herein present 3 advanced cancer patients with pulmonary metastasis and who received RT.
SEMI	NEG	PMC5228676.xml	S18	Introduction	NEG	In addition to the direct cytoreductive effect, emerging evidence suggests that the generation of antitumor immune responses may play an important role in the effectiveness of RT.[4,5]
SEMI	NEG	PMC5228676.xml	S38	Case presentation	NEG	Radiotherapy, total 60 Gy in 15 fractions, was also performed to gross right neck tumors from June 5th, 2015.
SEMI	NEG	PMC5228676.xml	S46	Case presentation	NEG	He then underwent photodynamic therapy (PDT) for pulmonary, pleural lesions, and radiofrequency ablations for hepatic metastasis.
SEMI	NEG	PMC5228677.xml	S20	Introduction	NEG	Mucosal melanomas are a rare clinical entity, in the literature the incidence is described with 1% to 2% of all melanomas and 2 to 2.6 per 1,000,000 persons/year.[1–3]
SEMI	NEG	PMC5228677.xml	S23	Introduction	NEG	It remains uncertain whether the poorer prognosis is due to the usually more progressed disease at initial diagnosis or to the biologically more aggressive growth.
SEMI	NEG	PMC5228677.xml	S33	Patients und methods	NEG	Since the American Joint Committee on Cancer-classification[6] for cutaneous melanoma is not established for mucosal melanoma, we implemented 3 groups for a clinical tumor grading according to the Mucosal Melanoma Staging System published by Iversen and Robins[7] in 1980 and proposed by Thoelke et al: I – local tumor, II – regional lymph node metastasis, and III – distant metastasis.[8,9]
SEMI	NEG	PMC5228677.xml	S65	Results	NEG	An initial local recurrence or in transit metastasis was recorded in 18/48 patients, regional lymph node metastasis in 8/48 patients, and distant metastasis in 22/48 patients.
SEMI	NEG	PMC5228678.xml	S18		NEG	Primary care in both developed and developing countries has experienced rapid expansion of private ownership and for-profit care delivery.[1–3]
SEMI	NEG	PMC5228678.xml	S22		NEG	CHCs employ a team of 20 to 100 staff of doctors, nurses, public health specialists, and administrators.
SEMI	NEG	PMC5228678.xml	S108		NEG	We compared primary care scores among those who were 60 or older, a total of 865 participants in the 3 cities, as they have greater needs for primary care.
SEMI	NEG	PMC5228678.xml	S148		NEG	In Shenzhen, such a referral letter is needed only for patients who are under the migrant health insurance scheme.[38]
SEMI	NEG	PMC5228679.xml	S3	Abstract	NEG	The incidence of colorectal cancer is rapidly increasing in South Korea.
SEMI	NEG	PMC5228679.xml	S19	Introduction	NEG	More than half of the cases occur in developed countries and incidence rates vary nearly 10-fold by region.[1]
SEMI	NEG	PMC5228679.xml	S34	Introduction	NEG	Most colorectal cancers arise from benign adenomas that develop over several years through an adenoma-carcinoma sequence.[16]
SEMI	NEG	PMC5228679.xml	S79	Method	NEG	Odds ratios (ORs) for colorectal adenomatous polyps in the higher intake groups (Q2–Q5) were calculated using multivariable logistic regression analysis by using the lowest (Q1) as the reference group.
SEMI	NEG	PMC5228679.xml	S110	Results	NEG	There were 625 participants with an adenoma in the proximal colon, and 448 had an adenoma in the distal colon; in both sexes, no significant associations were found between fat intake and the risk of proximal or distal colorectal adenoma.
SEMI	NEG	PMC5228679.xml	S120	Discussion	NEG	Some case-control studies have suggested that animal fat intake shows a positive association with risk of colorectal cancer[7,8]; moreover, other studies have shown that high SFA intake is associated with increased risk of colorectal cancer[5] or adenoma[6,23] Our study analyzed both animal fat and SFA intake; only SFA intake was positively associated with colorectal adenoma, in part consistent with the results of prior studies.
SEMI	NEG	PMC5228679.xml	S156	Discussion	NEG	These reasons highlight the clinical significance of our study in which we analyzed dietary fat intakes by source and specific fatty acids using a large sample size in the Korean population.
SEMI	POS	PMC5228679.xml	S157	Discussion	POS	Our study has several limitations.
SEMI	POS	PMC5228679.xml	S158	Discussion	POS	First, a cross-sectional study design cannot explicate the causal relationship between nutrition and colorectal adenoma.
SEMI	POS	PMC5228679.xml	S159	Discussion	POS	However, our study was conducted in asymptomatic, healthy participants who are more likely to maintain a consistent dietary habit.
SEMI	POS	PMC5228679.xml	S160	Discussion	POS	Second, the nutritional assessment through a 1-day food record was somewhat limited in terms of reflecting the usual dietary behaviors, although persons exhibiting an extreme range of total calorie intake were excluded.
SEMI	POS	PMC5228679.xml	S161	Discussion	POS	Third, we could not analyze specific subtypes of unsaturated fatty acid or trans-fatty acid associated with risk of colorectal cancer in more detail, owing to the limited dietary information in the Korean database.
SEMI	POS	PMC5228679.xml	S162	Discussion	POS	For the same reason, we could not conduct additional analyses by food group, such as red or processed meat, fruit, and vegetables.
SEMI	POS	PMC5228679.xml	S163	Discussion	POS	Fourth, potential confounding factors, such as hormonal status in female participants, were not adjusted for because of the absence of data.
SEMI	NEG	PMC5228680.xml	S32	Introduction	NEG	This is important because it gives us the possibility to control the disease, at least partially, through modifying habits.
SEMI	NEG	PMC5228680.xml	S83	Materials and methods	NEG	However, the validity of self-reported glaucoma diagnosis was also assessed in a subsample of our cohort.
SEMI	NEG	PMC5228680.xml	S85	Materials and methods	NEG	This validation study showed an adequate validity of the self-reported diagnosis of glaucoma: the Kappa value was 0.85 (95% coefficient interval [CI], 0.834–0.872).
SEMI	NEG	PMC5228680.xml	S162	Discussion	NEG	In addition, we found a dose–response relationship that demonstrates that the risk of glaucoma increases as the number of cigarette pack-years increases.
SEMI	NEG	PMC5228683.xml	S17		NEG	Therefore, new therapeutic targets are urgently needed.
SEMI	NEG	PMC5228683.xml	S25		NEG	Among esophageal adenocarcinoma and squamous cell carcinoma specimens, 100.0% of the assessed tumors were VEGFR2-positive.[10]
SEMI	NEG	PMC5228683.xml	S63		NEG	Beta-2-microglobulin, TATA box-binding protein, and transferrin receptor were used as control genes.
SEMI	NEG	PMC5228683.xml	S133		NEG	To the best of our knowledge, this is the first report to describe a negative prognostic value for higher VEGFR2 expression levels in patients with cervical cancer.
SEMI	NEG	PMC5228684.xml	S18	Abstract	NEG	However, the consciousness was still in deep coma.

SEMI	NEG	PMC5236064.xml	S174	Discussion	NEG	Baseline severity slightly moderated the effects of treatment; as in other trials,36 the magnitude of the effect was largest among participants with severe depression, but unlike those other trials, the effect is also present among those less severely depressed.
SEMI	NEG	PMC5236064.xml	S179	Discussion	NEG	The pragmatic emphasis on behaviour change in HAP might be valuable to guide individuals with depression to improve functional capacity and capacity to work.
SEMI	POS	PMC5236064.xml	S187	Discussion	POS	The study has certain limitations.
SEMI	POS	PMC5236064.xml	S188	Discussion	POS	First, even though HAP was better than what is usually done, about a third of participants remained depressed even after treatment.
SEMI	POS	PMC5236064.xml	S189	Discussion	POS	Our emphasis on the brevity of the intervention could possibly have resulted in this less than optimal absolute effect.
SEMI	POS	PMC5236064.xml	S190	Discussion	POS	Still, we believe at the very least that HAP would be a suitable candidate for the initial intervention in a stepped care system of treatment delivery for severe depression.40
SEMI	POS	PMC5236064.xml	S191	Discussion	POS	Second, our two measures of depression were somewhat discordant at the end of treatment; thus, although BDI-II scores suggested that patients ended treatment at the low end of the moderate range of severity (on the basis of the norms used in trials in high-income countries),41 PHQ-9 indicated only mild residual symptoms.
SEMI	POS	PMC5236064.xml	S192	Discussion	POS	We have more confidence in PHQ-9 than in BDI-II in this regard as it has been used extensively cross-culturally and validated in the study setting.19
SEMI	POS	PMC5236064.xml	S193	Discussion	POS	Furthermore, we caution against application of the existing norms to our study population as BDI-II was administered in an interview format rather than as self-report.
SEMI	POS	PMC5236064.xml	S194	Discussion	POS	Third, diagnostic interviews were not carried out at baseline, although PHQ-9 is widely used to define case-level morbidity in trials and, importantly, we used locally validated cutoffs in this study.19
SEMI	POS	PMC5236064.xml	S195	Discussion	POS	Finally, the results in this study are restricted to the primary endpoint outcomes at 3 months for which our interest lies in the response and remission to our treatment of participants with moderately severe to severe depression.
SEMI	POS	PMC5236064.xml	S196	Discussion	POS	We intend to assess the sustainability of these outcomes, including recovery from depression, at a 12 month follow-up.
SEMI	NEG	PMC5236065.xml	S9	Summary	NEG	Participants were randomly allocated (1:1) by trained health assistants based at the primary health centres to enhanced usual care (EUC) alone or EUC combined with CAP, in randomly sized blocks of four to six, stratified by primary health centre, and allocation was concealed with use of sequential numbered opaque envelopes.
SEMI	NEG	PMC5236065.xml	S10	Summary	NEG	Physicians providing EUC and those assessing outcomes were masked.
SEMI	NEG	PMC5236065.xml	S14	Summary	NEG	We used logistic regression analysis for remission and zero-inflated negative binomial regression analysis for alcohol consumption.
SEMI	NEG	PMC5236065.xml	S22	Summary	NEG	We noted no significant difference in the number of serious adverse events between the two groups (six [4%] in the EUC plus CAP group vs 13 [8%] in the EUC alone group; p=0·11).
SEMI	NEG	PMC5236065.xml	S48	Introduction	NEG	PREMIUM (Program for Effective Mental Health Interventions in Under-Resourced Health Systems) is a research programme whose goal was to design methods for development and assessment of scalable psychological treatments that are culturally appropriate, affordable, and feasible for delivery by NSHWs and to apply these methods14 to depression (the Healthy Activity Program [HAP])15 and harmful drinking (Counselling for Alcohol Problems [CAP]).16
SEMI	NEG	PMC5236065.xml	S86	Methods	NEG	11 counsellors participated in the trial.
SEMI	NEG	PMC5236065.xml	S92	Methods	NEG	We measured the primary outcomes 3 months after enrolment.
SEMI	NEG	PMC5236065.xml	S94	Methods	NEG	SIP mean score was prespecified as a primary outcome in the protocol; however, in a joint meeting of the Trial Steering Committee and Data Monitoring and Safety Committee before unmasking, SIP mean score was changed to a secondary outcome to reduce multiplicity of the primary outcomes.
SEMI	NEG	PMC5236065.xml	S119	Methods	NEG	We estimated the costs of CAP by attaching appropriate local Indian unit costs to each resource required to deliver each component of the intervention, including training, supervision, travel, and materials.
SEMI	NEG	PMC5236065.xml	S124	Methods	NEG	We calculated cost per additional remission or non-drinker achieved and quality-adjusted life-year (QALY) gained.
SEMI	NEG	PMC5236065.xml	S125	Methods	NEG	We compared differences in mean costs using standard parametric tests.
SEMI	NEG	PMC5236065.xml	S131	Methods	NEG	A Data and Safety Monitoring Committee oversaw the trial.
SEMI	NEG	PMC5236065.xml	S177	Discussion	NEG	However, both of these previous studies targeted hazardous or binge drinkers, and only one37 was based in primary care.
SEMI	POS	PMC5236065.xml	S194	Discussion	POS	The study had several limitations.
SEMI	POS	PMC5236065.xml	S195	Discussion	POS	Reliance on self-reported outcome data entails susceptibility to social desirability bias, and this factor might have varied by group.43
SEMI	POS	PMC5236065.xml	S196	Discussion	POS	Reasons for under-reporting might have included the participant actually believing the information that they reported (self-deception) or so-called faking good to conform to socially acceptable values, avoid criticism, or gain social approval.
SEMI	POS	PMC5236065.xml	S197	Discussion	POS	However, more objective measures such as biomarkers are insensitive to alcohol use disorder except for when it is severe, and alcohol treatment trials have not found advantages in use of collateral reports or other alternatives.44
SEMI	POS	PMC5236065.xml	S198	Discussion	POS	Biomarkers might, in time, be developed for use in clinical trials, although at present the most promising ones available do not accurately and sensitively estimate levels of consumption.45
SEMI	POS	PMC5236065.xml	S199	Discussion	POS	The results in our study are restricted to the primary outcomes at 3 months where our interest lies in the response and remission of participants with harmful drinking after our treatment.
SEMI	POS	PMC5236065.xml	S200	Discussion	POS	We intend to assess the sustainability of these outcomes, including recovery from harmful drinking, at a 12 month follow-up.
SEMI	POS	PMC5236065.xml	S201	Discussion	POS	No cost-effectiveness thresholds have been established for alcohol outcomes in India; we have conservatively assumed that this threshold is no more than the monthly wage for an unskilled worker.
SEMI	POS	PMC5236065.xml	S202	Discussion	POS	The absence of effect on QALYs might be viewed in the context of doubt about the capacity of standard measures such as those used in this study to capture improvements in alcohol-related quality of life.46
SEMI	POS	PMC5236065.xml	S203	Discussion	POS	A delayed effect of reduced drinking or abstinence on QALYs could also be possible and we could perhaps expect to see a differential effect between the two groups at the 12 month outcome assessment.
SEMI	POS	PMC5236065.xml	S204	Discussion	POS	Finally, our findings cannot be generalised to women as CAP was developed and tested only in men.
SEMI	POS	PMC5236065.xml	S205	Discussion	POS	However, none of the content of CAP is sex specific and in our opinion there is no theoretical reason to believe that CAP would not work in women.
SEMI	POS	PMC5236065.xml	S206	Discussion	POS	Nevertheless, as alcohol consumption and its resulting problems are starting to increase in India, albeit from an extremely small base, study of this treatment in female harmful drinkers is needed.
SEMI	NEG	PMC5237203.xml	S12	Background	NEG	After correction for lung function, gender and body mass index (BMI), TLCO%pred did not significantly differ between patients with and without diabetes.
SEMI	NEG	PMC5237203.xml	S45	Methods	NEG	Spirometric parameters comprised forced expiratory volume in one second (FEV1), forced vital capacity (FVC) and their ratio (FEV1/FVC); bodyplethysmographic parameters included intrathoracic gas volume (ITGV) and total lung capacity (TLC).
SEMI	NEG	PMC5237203.xml	S47	Methods	NEG	This measurement yielded the transfer factor for CO (TLCO) and the transfer coefficient (KCO) as the ratio of TLCO and alveolar volume (VA).
SEMI	NEG	PMC5237203.xml	S77	Results	NEG	Patients with diabetes showed a lower number of gender-related significant differences, including FEV1%pred but not TLCO%pred.
SEMI	NEG	PMC5237203.xml	S80	Results	NEG	Moreover Table 2 presents the results of comparisons between diabetic and non-diabetic patients for males and females separately.
SEMI	NEG	PMC5237203.xml	S97	Results	NEG	Analysis of covariance (ANCOVA) showed that there was no significant interaction term between gender and diabetes.
SEMI	NEG	PMC5237203.xml	S98	Results	NEG	In case of TLCO%pred, regression analysis revealed that FEV1%pred, RV%pred, ITGV%pred and gender were significant predictors (p < 0.001 each) while diabetes was borderline non-significant (p = 0.056).
SEMI	NEG	PMC5237203.xml	S103	Results	NEG	Thus BMI appeared to be a decisive factor for the differences in CO diffusing capacity between diabetes and non-diabetes.
SEMI	POS	PMC5237203.xml	S163	Discussion	POS	We could statistically adjust for a number of factors but mostly without interaction terms which would have required an even greater sample size.
SEMI	POS	PMC5237203.xml	S164	Discussion	POS	In addition the analysis was influenced by the unequal distribution of males and females across the two groups.
SEMI	POS	PMC5237203.xml	S165	Discussion	POS	This was relevant as even in the group without diabetes the parameters of CO diffusing capacity were gender-dependent.
SEMI	POS	PMC5237203.xml	S166	Discussion	POS	Information on the type and duration of diabetes was not available.
SEMI	POS	PMC5237203.xml	S167	Discussion	POS	The extended definition represented patients with lower HbA1c levels and probably better glycemic control compared to patients obeying the restrictive definition.
SEMI	POS	PMC5237203.xml	S168	Discussion	POS	A further grouping into patients with very poor glycemic control, e.g.
SEMI	POS	PMC5237203.xml	S169	Discussion	POS	HbA1c values ≥8% or insulin-monotherapy, did not yield conclusive results, probably due to the small sample sizes associated with these requirements.
SEMI	POS	PMC5237203.xml	S170	Discussion	POS	The statistical analyses indicated that the diabetes definition was not critical for the major finding, therefore the identification of diabetes patients was probably not a limiting factor in the study.
SEMI	POS	PMC5237203.xml	S171	Discussion	POS	A further limitation is that a detailed analysis of comorbidities was not possible due to the relatively small numbers that remained, particularly for their combinations, in the diabetes group.
SEMI	POS	PMC5237203.xml	S172	Discussion	POS	Moreover these comorbidities could not be verified by specific medication to the same extent as diabetes.
SEMI	NEG	PMC5237203.xml	S174	Conclusion	NEG	The analysis of data from a large COPD cohort showed that the transfer factor TLCO in terms of %predicted did not significantly differ between patients with and without diabetes, if other differences, especially those of lung function and body weight, were taken into account.
SEMI	NEG	PMC5237203.xml	S176	Conclusion	NEG	Former investigations in diabetes patients without lung disease showed an impairment of CO diffusing capacity.
SEMI	NEG	PMC5237352.xml	S31	Background	NEG	Specifically, we observed reduced adaptive T cell responses including reductions in protective T cell responses (i.e.
SEMI	NEG	PMC5237352.xml	S32	Background	NEG	Tc1 and Th1) following influenza infection [10].
SEMI	NEG	PMC5237352.xml	S180	Results	NEG	Body weight gain, peak pulmonary viral load (4dpi), and adaptive T cell responses (6dpi) were analyzed.
SEMI	NEG	PMC5237352.xml	S233	Discussion	NEG	The reasons for such differences are currently unclear, but they could be a result of differences in maturation status of the immune and/or pulmonary systems.
SEMI	NEG	PMC5237405.xml	S11	Background	NEG	By conditioning on polymorphisms associated with PD and AD, we found 11 loci associated with increased risk for FTD.
SEMI	NEG	PMC5237513.xml	S7	Background	NEG	Patients in this analysis were enrolled in a cross-sectional study.
SEMI	NEG	PMC5237513.xml	S45	Methods	NEG	Specifically we will (i) compare assessment tools (pedometer and IPAQ) to our criterion method (ActiGraph) for the measurement of physical activity dimensions, and (ii) assess the feasibility and acceptability of objective assessment tools (ActiGraph, pedometer) and subjective assessment tools (IPAQ) to assess physical activity dimensions in BE from two perspectives: those of the participants’ and those of the researchers’ conducting the outcome measurements.
SEMI	NEG	PMC5237513.xml	S47	Methods	NEG	Patients in this analysis were enrolled in a cross-sectional study using quantitative methodology.
SEMI	NEG	PMC5237513.xml	S77	Methods	NEG	It was chosen as it allows participants to include leisure/exercise, walking, occupation, and transportation physical activity in their responses, and the scoring protocol allows greater flexibility in how physical activity is accumulated than other questionnaires [10, 25].
SEMI	NEG	PMC5240376.xml	S12	Background	NEG	We examined 182 eligible cases, average age was 66 years old, and 86% were male.
SEMI	NEG	PMC5240376.xml	S17	Background	NEG	Moreover, a score higher than 30 points in the SGRQ total score showed higher mortality rate (HR, 2.047; 95% CI, 1.329–3.153; P = .001
SEMI	NEG	PMC5240376.xml	S53	Methods	NEG	The present study was approved by a local institutional review board (IRB No.
SEMI	NEG	PMC5240376.xml	S86	Results	NEG	Mean percent predicted FVC was 79.7%, mean percent predicted DLco was 58.2%.
SEMI	NEG	PMC5240376.xml	S94	Results	NEG	Because the SGRQ total score included all domain scores of the SGRQ and there were high correlations between the total score and each domain score, we only used the SGRQ total score in multivariate analysis.
SEMI	POS	PMC5240376.xml	S123	Discussion	POS	The present study had some limitations.
SEMI	POS	PMC5240376.xml	S124	Discussion	POS	First, this is a retrospective, single-centered study, and so there may be selection bias.
SEMI	POS	PMC5240376.xml	S125	Discussion	POS	Further large prospective studies will be needed to assess the relationship between the SGRQ and mortality rate.
SEMI	POS	PMC5240376.xml	S126	Discussion	POS	Next, because we examined mild to moderate cases, results may differ in a different cohort.
SEMI	POS	PMC5240376.xml	S127	Discussion	POS	Lastly, all the patients in the present study were Japanese, and it is unclear whether the findings will apply to people of different ethnicities.
SEMI	NEG	PMC5241201.xml	S80		NEG	Ribosome biogenesis was represented by 99 proteins showing different phases of nuclear accumulation, corresponding to distinct steps (de la Cruz et al., 2015) (Figure 4A; Table S4; related to Figure 4).
SEMI	NEG	PMC5241201.xml	S84		NEG	Lastly, the final assembly of the ribosomes in the nucleolus involves the rhythmic nuclear accumulation of the pre-60S ribosome (Nissan et al., 2002) and the large-subunit processome (LSU) (McCann et al., 2015) with peak phases near ZT22 (Figure S4A).
SEMI	NEG	PMC5241201.xml	S96		NEG	To further study the diurnal phosphoproteome and its associated kinome activity, we used the same nuclear extracts and performed SILAC MS after enriching for phosphopeptides.
SEMI	NEG	PMC5241201.xml	S109		NEG	Among these kinases, several were known as regulators of the circadian clock.
SEMI	NEG	PMC5241227.xml	S4	Summary	NEG	To address the physiological function of TFEB in skeletal muscle, we have used muscle-specific gain- and loss-of-function approaches.
SEMI	NEG	PMC5241227.xml	S106		NEG	To better understand the exercise intolerance of the TFEB KO mice, we examined energy expenditure during treadmill running.
SEMI	NEG	PMC5241227.xml	S158		NEG	Finally, EM showed an accumulation of glycogen in PGC1α KO mice that were infected by AAV2.1-TFEB (Figure S4B).
SEMI	NEG	PMC5241227.xml	S184		NEG	The positive effects of TFEB on the mitochondrial network in skeletal muscle appear to be independent from PGC1α.
SEMI	NEG	PMC5241923.xml	S47	Methods	NEG	Bronchodilator (BD) reversibility test was considered positive if there was an increase in FEV1 of >12% and >200 mL from baseline, 10–15 min after 200 mcg salbutamol inhalation.
SEMI	NEG	PMC5241923.xml	S49	Methods	NEG	Patients known to have systemic inflammatory diseases were excluded from this study.
SEMI	NEG	PMC5241923.xml	S88	Discussion	NEG	In the current study, there was a significant statistical increase of SCF mRNA expression in asthmatic group when compared to controls, Furthermore, this expression is significantly increased in atopic than non-atopic patients.
SEMI	NEG	PMC5241923.xml	S106	Discussion	NEG	El-Gazzar et al., [30] demonstrated that the serum level of SCF was higher in asthmatic patients especially among eosinophilic phenotype than among healthy control subjects.
SEMI	NEG	PMC5241996.xml	S38		NEG	MAC-1 binds to intracellular adhesion molecule-1 (ICAM-1) on the surface of endothelial cells.
SEMI	NEG	PMC5241996.xml	S114		NEG	Again, in a similar way to chronic bronchitis, patients with asthma have increased vasculature in their airways which might be important in the development of airway narrowing [53].
SEMI	NEG	PMC5241996.xml	S139		NEG	The relationship between FMD and FEV1 is explained by the percentage of emphysema on CT.
SEMI	NEG	PMC5241996.xml	S282		NEG	One study followed up COPD patients over the course of a year.
SEMI	NEG	PMC5244817.xml	S40		NEG	Several substantial pitfalls have been highlighted both in comparisons of performance across various tools and in external validations of specific tools.
SEMI	NEG	PMC5244817.xml	S54		NEG	Membership of Clalit Health Services comprises the general population, but for historical reasons the organisation has a slightly larger proportion of the older population and those from a lower socioeconomic class.33
SEMI	NEG	PMC5244817.xml	S60		NEG	In the second part of the study we conducted a tool specific external validation for performance in predicting fractures, using cohorts with varying age ranges for each tool.
SEMI	NEG	PMC5244817.xml	S72		NEG	Input variables included clinical status, prescription drug use, and demographic characteristics, according to the variables used in each of the tools.
SEMI	NEG	PMC5244817.xml	S74		NEG	To provide as comprehensive data as possible for the prediction tools, we based all input variables of the three prediction tools on information that was last documented as of the index date.
SEMI	NEG	PMC5244817.xml	S76		NEG	For variables that could potentially change over time (including body mass index, smoking status, alcoholism, nursing home residency, history of falls, and drug use), we took the last relevant documented history with no time limitation, and we also conducted a sensitivity analysis in which the extraction of such variables was limited to two years before the index date.
SEMI	NEG	PMC5244817.xml	S109		NEG	To compare across the three tools, which were developed using different modelling methods, we used the provided risk probabilities for each tool respectively and treated the outcome as if it were a binary variable (fracture or no fracture).
SEMI	NEG	PMC5244817.xml	S115		NEG	In three separate sensitivity analyses we further evaluated the discrimination measures in the comparative analysis: limitation of the time range of variables with less chronic nature, complete case analysis, and a subpopulation that excluded patients who were being treated for osteoporosis in the two years before the index date.
SEMI	NEG	PMC5244817.xml	S140		NEG	A total of 113 591 (10.8%) people died during the follow-up period.
SEMI	NEG	PMC5244817.xml	S149		NEG	The specificity and negative predictive values were high and comparable for all three tools (table 2).
SEMI	NEG	PMC5244817.xml	S152		NEG	The confidence interval for the difference between the FRAX and QFracture AUCs was 0.1-0.3%.
SEMI	NEG	PMC5244817.xml	S206		NEG	This study has several strengths in its methods, analyses, and findings and implications for practical real world application.
SEMI	POS	PMC5244817.xml	S218		POS	Two of these (family history of osteoporosis and hip fractures) were reflections of data limitations, specifically lower rates of well defined family connections for older adults.
SEMI	POS	PMC5244817.xml	S219		POS	Smoking status, the third variable that did not follow the anticipated direction, was possibly affected by confounding, since younger men were more likely to be current smokers in the study population (data not shown).
SEMI	POS	PMC5244817.xml	S220		POS	This study has several limitations.
SEMI	POS	PMC5244817.xml	S221		POS	While previous studies commonly report probabilities for 10 years of follow-up, we were only able to evaluate the probabilities of fracture risk for five years owing to limited availability of robust baseline data as of 1 January 2005.
SEMI	POS	PMC5244817.xml	S222		POS	It has been noted that AUC performance can be potentially affected by the duration of follow-up.12 30
SEMI	POS	PMC5244817.xml	S223		POS	To address this point, we conducted a preliminary analysis and found that the rate of fracture events is approximately constant, meaning that the cumulative rate of events is linear, as presented in our supplementary material as well as in previous studies.23
SEMI	POS	PMC5244817.xml	S224		POS	This trend not only substantiates the conversion of 10 year FRAX probabilities into five year probabilities, but also supports an assumption that the performance of the five year probabilities likely reflects the performance of the 10 year probabilities.
SEMI	POS	PMC5244817.xml	S225		POS	Furthermore, from a clinical perspective, the five year probabilities might be more useful for prevention and intervention, since the long term safety of bisphosphonates for fracture prevention after five years is unclear.54 55
SEMI	POS	PMC5244817.xml	S226		POS	Secondly, the evaluation of FRAX relied on probability charts, which provide a cruder risk assessment than complete tool equations.
SEMI	POS	PMC5244817.xml	S227		POS	Since FRAX achieved good discrimination, which aligns well with previous studies, it is reasonable to conclude that this limitation did not substantially affect its performance.
SEMI	POS	PMC5244817.xml	S228		POS	Finally, as is often the case in electronic health record databases, we did not have extensive data on bone mineral density (in a large enough proportion of the overall population throughout the study timeline) to include it as an input variable for the tools that do offer a bone mineral density option.
SEMI	POS	PMC5244817.xml	S229		POS	Given that bone mineral density screening is not performed in a substantial part of the adult population,7 8 9 10 and the fact that QFracture does not include bone mineral density as an input, we have reason to believe that despite this omission, our results are meaningful for practical application.
SEMI	NEG	PMC5248528.xml	S5	Background	NEG	During pathological remodeling driven by inflammatory cells and proteases, fragments of these proteins are released into the bloodstream, where they may serve as biomarkers for disease phenotypes.
SEMI	NEG	PMC5248528.xml	S21	Background	NEG	The current treatment options for disease modification in COPD are limited [1, 2].
SEMI	NEG	PMC5248528.xml	S31	Background	NEG	Recently, an increased attention to identification of phenotypes in COPD has been pursued consequent to the lack of success in drug development in broader disease populations with functional modulators [3].
SEMI	NEG	PMC5248528.xml	S32	Background	NEG	Several researchers have suggested changing the respiratory phenotypes into more targetable and treatable traits [21].
SEMI	NEG	PMC5248528.xml	S35	Background	NEG	Results from the ECLIPSE study suggest that a frequent-exacerbator phenotype exists, irrespective of disease severity, and that the best predictor of future exacerbations is a history of exacerbations [24], albeit others did not replicate this finding and found smoking to be the only predictor of acute respiratory episodes [25].
SEMI	NEG	PMC5248528.xml	S40	Background	NEG	Possibly a new form of inflammatory and structural biomarkers may provide value, such as biomarkers of tissue turnover driven by inflammation [32–34].
SEMI	NEG	PMC5248528.xml	S45	Background	NEG	This equilibrium is out of balance in diseases affecting connective tissue, and in the case of COPD, may results in an increase in both formation and degradation of tissue in the peripheral airway wall which may lead to tissue disruption and fibrosis [32, 38].
SEMI	NEG	PMC5248528.xml	S61	Methods	NEG	All patients underwent a clinical examination including blood sampling, spirometry to assess lung function, questionnaires to assess the quality of life (The Short Form 36 (SF-36) [52]), and CT-scan upon inclusion in the trial.
SEMI	NEG	PMC5248528.xml	S67	Methods	NEG	ECM-related biomarkers of type I collagen degradation by MMPs (C1M), type VI collagen degradation by MMPs or formation (C6M, Pro-C6) and elastin degraded by neutrophil elastase (EL-NE) were measured in serum samples from the 89 subjects using highly specific Enzyme-Linked Immunosorbent Assays (ELISAs) for such fragments.
SEMI	NEG	PMC5248528.xml	S73	Methods	NEG	Correlation of biomarkers with lung function, the SF-36 quality of life patient reported outcome, and haematology test results including eosinophil counts were performed using Spearman’s correlation.
SEMI	NEG	PMC5248528.xml	S76	Results	NEG	The mean age of COPD patients was 69.5 years (inter-quartile range (IQR): 66–75), while the control patients had a mean age of 63.6 years (IQR 56–70).
SEMI	NEG	PMC5248528.xml	S88	Results	NEG	EL-NE was particularly associated with emphysema only, as the concentrations of this biomarker was significantly elevated in this subgroup compared to smoking controls (p < 0.05) and never-smoking controls (p < 0.005), but was not found to be significantly elevated in mixed disease and obstructive, non-emphysematous, COPD compared to controls (Fig. 2).
SEMI	POS	PMC5248528.xml	S139	Discussion	POS	This report has several limitations.
SEMI	POS	PMC5248528.xml	S140	Discussion	POS	The data shown was analysed in a fairly limited number of subjects, and the statistical power is further reduced by sub-division of COPD patients into phenotypes, and healthy subjects into smokers and non-smokers.
SEMI	POS	PMC5248528.xml	S141	Discussion	POS	The study did not include a well-defined control group of never-smoking controls with emphysema, which could have further supported the findings related to biomarker elevations of the emphysema phenotype if similar results were found.
SEMI	POS	PMC5248528.xml	S142	Discussion	POS	A number of observations of elevated biomarkers were not found to be statistically significant between COPD patients and non-COPD smoker control subjects in this analysis.
SEMI	POS	PMC5248528.xml	S143	Discussion	POS	This may in part be explained by the relatively few smoking controls included in the analysis, as visual inspection of the data as shown in the figures indicate a difference which may have the potential to reach statistical significance had the statistical power been higher.
SEMI	POS	PMC5248528.xml	S144	Discussion	POS	The findings of the present analyses were not validated in a separate validation cohort for the purpose of this report.
SEMI	POS	PMC5248528.xml	S145	Discussion	POS	However, recent published report with the same biomarkers in other well-known COPD cohorts support the findings that C6M and EL-NE are significantly associated with lung function in COPD [73, 74], and have been found to be elevated during exacerbations in a smaller study [56].
SEMI	POS	PMC5248528.xml	S146	Discussion	POS	Construct validity of blood-based biomarkers is often questioned, as definitive evidence that a particular biomarkers indeed does originate from a certain organ or disease mechanism is often scarce.
SEMI	POS	PMC5248528.xml	S147	Discussion	POS	As the main clinical phenotype under study in the COPDGene cohort is lung disease, it appears reasonable to assume that the origin is the lungs, although elastin and collagen are both abundant in other major organs of the body such as the skin.
SEMI	POS	PMC5248528.xml	S148	Discussion	POS	The role of elastin in the alveoli is described in the literature, and results indicate that particularly elastin is a major target in the pathogenesis of emphysema [75], which supports the finding of emphysema associated with EL-NE.
SEMI	POS	PMC5248528.xml	S149	Discussion	POS	Previous research to link these protease-specific ECM-fragments with the lungs have resulted in a number of reports which support the hypothesized association.
SEMI	POS	PMC5248528.xml	S150	Discussion	POS	The biomarkers analysed in this report have, in addition to in COPD, been found to be significantly elevated in other respiratory diseases, such as idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis [50, 76, 77] and lung cancer [50], indicating that these fragments are likely to originate from pathological turnover of lung tissue, yet no definitive proof currently exists.
SEMI	NEG	PMC5256147.xml	S3	Background	NEG	Prevalence of atrial fibrillation (AF) is increasing, due partly to the ageing population.
SEMI	NEG	PMC5256147.xml	S11	Background	NEG	Scope for improved prevention at older ages was considerable.
SEMI	NEG	PMC5256147.xml	S13	Background	NEG	Of the 189 patients not anticoagulated, 166 (87.8%) had no major disability prior to the event and 167 (88·4%) had a high embolism risk score, of whom 139 (83.2%) were also at low risk of complications.
SEMI	NEG	PMC5256147.xml	S22	Introduction	NEG	AF-related ischaemic strokes also tend to be severe and to incur high mean costs,4 and non-cerebral systemic embolism secondary to AF is also a major burden.5
SEMI	NEG	PMC5256147.xml	S34	Methods	NEG	Case ascertainment uses multiple overlapping methods of hot and cold pursuit (see online supplementary S3) and has been shown to be near complete.17
SEMI	NEG	PMC5256147.xml	S40	Methods	NEG	Clinical study reports of all strokes were reviewed by the senior study neurologist and reports of all PVEs were reviewed by a vascular surgeon.
SEMI	NEG	PMC5256147.xml	S46	Methods	NEG	In all patients with known prior AF, we used premorbid clinical characteristics to calculate the CHADS2 score19 and CHA2DS2VASc score20 for risk of embolic ischaemic events, and the HAS-BLED score21 for the risk of bleeding on anticoagulation.
SEMI	NEG	PMC5256147.xml	S49	Methods	NEG	All patients had face-to-face follow-up at 1, 6, 12, 24, 60 and 120 months after the event to assess outcomes.
SEMI	NEG	PMC5256147.xml	S51	Methods	NEG	Follow-up was conducted via a carer if the patient was unable to participate, for example, due to dementia.
SEMI	NEG	PMC5256147.xml	S61	Methods	NEG	We performed statistical analysis and graphical presentation using SPSS software V.20
SEMI	NEG	PMC5256147.xml	S70	Results	NEG	Incidence rates of AF-related ischaemic stroke or PVE were similar in men and women, but increased steeply with age, with 272/454 (59.9%) events occurring at ≥80 years (table 2, online supplementary tables S4–5).
SEMI	NEG	PMC5256147.xml	S79	Results	NEG	Consequently, of 597 incident ischaemic strokes that were fatal or disabling at 6 months follow-up, 262/597 (43·9%) were AF-related (age-adjusted OR=2.52, 1.87 to 3.41, p<0.0001) and 165 (27·6%) occurred in non-anticoagulated patients with known prior AF.
SEMI	NEG	PMC5256147.xml	S82	Results	NEG	Among the 336 patients with incident ischaemic stroke or PVE, and known prior AF (figure 3), only 56 (16.7%) were anticoagulated (46/274 stroke and 10/62 PVE), with no increase in rates since 2007 (32/178 vs 24/158 in 2002–2007, p=0.49).
SEMI	NEG	PMC5256147.xml	S112	Discussion	NEG	Even though the median CHADS2 (2–3), CHA2DS2VASc (4–5) and HAS-BLED (1–2) scores were relatively low among OXVASC patients with ischaemic event and known prior AF (probably reflecting the overall low risk for bleeding complications in this population), the embolic risk was consistently higher than the bleeding risk among those at ≥80 years (see online supplementary table S10).
SEMI	NEG	PMC5256147.xml	S117	Discussion	NEG	This finding indirectly supports observations from large cohort studies that the net clinical benefit favoured anticoagulation for almost all patients with AF at the population level except for those with very low embolic risk.32 33
SEMI	POS	PMC5256147.xml	S120	Discussion	POS	Our study has several limitations.
SEMI	POS	PMC5256147.xml	S121	Discussion	POS	First, our findings cannot necessarily be generalised to other populations or healthcare systems.
SEMI	POS	PMC5256147.xml	S122	Discussion	POS	For example, rates of prior anticoagulation in patients with incident ischaemic stroke in OXVASC are somewhat lower than those in other recent stroke incidence studies (see online supplementary figure S2).
SEMI	POS	PMC5256147.xml	S123	Discussion	POS	However, under-use of anticoagulants is widely documented in all countries in which it has been studied, population ageing is widespread and other studies show that a high proportion of AF-related strokes occur at ages over 80 years.31
SEMI	POS	PMC5256147.xml	S124	Discussion	POS	Second, about a quarter of our patients aged ≥80 with known prior AF had paroxysmal AF.
SEMI	POS	PMC5256147.xml	S125	Discussion	POS	However, the anticoagulation rate was low for both paroxysmal and permanent AF.
SEMI	POS	PMC5256147.xml	S126	Discussion	POS	Third, the lack of a documented reason in primary care or hospital records for patients with known prior AF for not being on warfarin might reflect poor documentation rather than under-treatment.
SEMI	POS	PMC5256147.xml	S127	Discussion	POS	However, the small number of patients who had been on warfarin previously but had discontinued its use was consistent with under-anticoagulation, as were the relatively low HAS-BLED scores in the majority of untreated patients, and our findings are consistent with previous studies.
SEMI	POS	PMC5256147.xml	S128	Discussion	POS	Fourth, although our retrospective calculation of the embolic and bleeding risk scores might have introduced some inaccuracies, information obtained from patients was cross-referenced with both hospital and primary care records.
SEMI	POS	PMC5256147.xml	S129	Discussion	POS	Fifth, not all vascular events in patients with AF would have been prevented by prior anticoagulation.
SEMI	POS	PMC5256147.xml	S130	Discussion	POS	However, warfarin reduces the rate of ischaemic stroke and PVE in primary prevention in AF by about 70% compared with placebo,6 7 and so most of the events in untreated patients would have been preventable.
SEMI	POS	PMC5256147.xml	S131	Discussion	POS	In keeping with this conclusion, we found an alternative aetiology for stroke in only a small proportion of cases (see online supplementary table S7).
SEMI	POS	PMC5256147.xml	S132	Discussion	POS	Finally, evidence often takes several years to change clinical practice and even then, the impact of any changes on risk of vascular events would be further delayed.
SEMI	POS	PMC5256147.xml	S133	Discussion	POS	Moreover, we did not have individual patient data on anticoagulation rates in our underlying study population without vascular events.
SEMI	POS	PMC5256147.xml	S134	Discussion	POS	However, the rate of AF-related vascular events was higher in 2010–2012 than in 2007–2009.
SEMI	NEG	PMC5256149.xml	S83	Results	NEG	Among those allocated MT, interventional times were short and consistent with protocol recommendations.
SEMI	NEG	PMC5256149.xml	S92	Results	NEG	In the ITT population, the difference in the proportion achieving mRS 0–2 at day 90 (51% vs 40%, adjusted OR 2.12, 95% CI 0.65 to 6.94, p=0.204) was not significant.
SEMI	NEG	PMC5256149.xml	S93	Results	NEG	In the per-protocol population, however, there was a significant effect in favour of adjunctive MT after adjustment for minimisation variables, with an absolute difference in the proportion achieving mRS 0–2 at day 90 of 22% (57% vs 35%, OR 4.92, 95% CI 1.23 to 19.69, p=0.021) (table 2 and figure 2).
SEMI	NEG	PMC5256149.xml	S98	Results	NEG	The estimated number needed to treat for one person to have mRS ≤2 at day 90 was 6.91 in the adjusted analysis.
SEMI	NEG	PMC5256393.xml	S29		NEG	The multiple mechanisms by which influenza may precipitate AMI are shown in figure 1.
SEMI	NEG	PMC5256393.xml	S35		NEG	However, each RCT showed efficacy of influenza vaccine against composite coronary morbidity and mortality outcomes.19 20
SEMI	NEG	PMC5256393.xml	S44		NEG	Pooled estimates from one systematic review revealed that people with established CHD who quit smoking had a 32% and 36% risk reduction in non-fatal myocardial infarction and all-cause mortality, respectively.24
SEMI	NEG	PMC5256393.xml	S48		NEG	In their meta-analysis, Pepine et al31 demonstrated that verapamil reduced the incidence of non-fatal reinfarction by 21% among patients with CVDs.
SEMI	NEG	PMC5256394.xml	S5	Objective	NEG	A matched cohort study was conducted using primary care electronic health records for one London borough.
SEMI	NEG	PMC5256394.xml	S32	Methods	NEG	Patients with a diagnosis of the selected disorders were matched on age, gender and general practice with up to four controls randomly sampled from all patients who were disease-free.
SEMI	NEG	PMC5256394.xml	S46	Methods	NEG	Ethnicity was categorised as missing if recorded as refused or not recorded.
SEMI	NEG	PMC5256394.xml	S52	Methods	NEG	Differences in the assessment of traditional CV risk factors and relevant treatment were compared between patients with RA and IBD with their matched controls without accounting for matching.
SEMI	NEG	PMC5256394.xml	S72	Results	NEG	Cumulatively, the percentage of patients with IBD and RA with CV risk factors assessed increased substantively and was most commonly performed with regard to SBP and less commonly for BMI.
SEMI	NEG	PMC5256394.xml	S87	Results	NEG	Patients with IBD presented higher rates of lipid-lowering therapy (3.21, 1.44 to 7.15) before the index date, but not post-IBD diagnosis.
SEMI	NEG	PMC5256394.xml	S89	Results	NEG	Patients with IBD presented similar association patterns, with the exception of BMI where no evidence of significant differences in assessment was evident.
SEMI	NEG	PMC5256394.xml	S125	Discussion	NEG	Patients were included only if they had been registered at the practice for 12 months or more, ensuring accurate date of diagnosis and reliable clinical and therapy data.
SEMI	POS	PMC5256394.xml	S127	Discussion	POS	However, as with any observational data there are important limitations that need acknowledgement.
SEMI	POS	PMC5256394.xml	S128	Discussion	POS	We drew on the READ code classification, used in UK primary care to identify chronic inflammatory disease diagnosis, comorbidities, treatment and risk factor management.
SEMI	POS	PMC5256394.xml	S129	Discussion	POS	We acknowledge that alternative codes might be proposed.
SEMI	POS	PMC5256394.xml	S130	Discussion	POS	Only data from primary care setting were available and no data from specialist clinics were available, which could impact the identification of patients and CV risk factors assessment into our study.
SEMI	POS	PMC5256394.xml	S131	Discussion	POS	Confounding is also common in observational studies and there may be other relevant factors that were unavailable to us.
SEMI	POS	PMC5256394.xml	S132	Discussion	POS	Also, primary care practitioners may record some of the CV risk factors data in a textual format, which was not available to us.
SEMI	POS	PMC5256394.xml	S133	Discussion	POS	It is also possible that primary care practitioners may not record CV risk factors information collected previously if there was no apparent change in these factors, particularly with respect to smoking and BMI.
SEMI	POS	PMC5256394.xml	S134	Discussion	POS	While this suggestion may partially explain the low rates of measurement for some CV risk factors, it is unlikely to be responsible for the low rates observed among SBP and cholesterol levels.
SEMI	POS	PMC5256394.xml	S135	Discussion	POS	The poor predictive value of existing risk scores may also discourage their use in inflammatory patients.
SEMI	NEG	PMC5256394.xml	S147	Conclusion	NEG	Less evidence is available, however, from primary care practices and across different inflammatory disorders.
SEMI	NEG	PMC5256395.xml	S5	Objective	NEG	In the preventive angioplasty in myocardial infarction trial (PRAMI; ISRCTN73028481), cardiac magnetic resonance (CMR) was prespecified in two centres and performed (median, IQR) 3 (1, 5) and 209 (189, 957) days after primary PCI.
SEMI	NEG	PMC5256395.xml	S20	Introduction	NEG	On the other hand, it may cause complications, including iatrogenic myocardial infarction secondary to the PCI procedure through coronary microembolisation leading to a larger overall infarct burden.3 4
SEMI	NEG	PMC5256395.xml	S26	Introduction	NEG	In 203 patients in the culprit cardiac magnetic resonance (CMR) substudy there was a statistically significant increase in non-infarct-related artery MI in the complete revascularisation group but total infarct size was not significantly different compared with an infarct related artery (IRA) only strategy.14
SEMI	NEG	PMC5256395.xml	S39	Methods	NEG	10.1136/heartjnl-2015-308660.supp1
SEMI	NEG	PMC5256395.xml	S49	Methods	NEG	Image quality was assessed using Likert scale quality scores.
SEMI	NEG	PMC5256395.xml	S59	Methods	NEG	The coronary angiograms underwent quantitative coronary analysis (QCA) of culprit and non-culprit lesions.
SEMI	NEG	PMC5256395.xml	S79	Results	NEG	Of these, 84 (38%) participants (mean age 60.4 SD 11.1 years, 77% male) (table 1) underwent CMR at baseline during the first week post-MI.
SEMI	NEG	PMC5256395.xml	S80	Results	NEG	Figure 1 illustrates the flow diagram of the randomised participants, including the reasons for not undergoing CMR.
SEMI	NEG	PMC5256395.xml	S86	Results	NEG	The Syntax and APPROACH scores and the American Heart Association classification of lesion complexity were similar in both groups.
SEMI	POS	PMC5256395.xml	S116	Discussion	POS	The main limitation of our study is the sample size.
SEMI	POS	PMC5256395.xml	S117	Discussion	POS	The study is underpowered to detect between-group differences in LV end-systolic volume (<3.0 mL/m2), LV ejection fraction and infarct size.
SEMI	POS	PMC5256395.xml	S118	Discussion	POS	We used oedema imaging qualitatively to identify areas of acute injury, however, we did not quantify the area-at-risk and myocardial salvage index, as two different T2-weighted sequences were used during the course of the study (see online supplement).
SEMI	POS	PMC5256395.xml	S119	Discussion	POS	CMR information on deceased patients was lacking.
SEMI	NEG	PMC5256395.xml	S127	Discussion	NEG	Based on our angiographic analysis, the non-culprit lesions had low-risk Syntax scores and 47% had non-complex characteristics (table 2), implying selection of lower risk lesions for immediate preventive PCI.
SEMI	NEG	PMC5256395.xml	S134	Discussion	NEG	By contrast in PRAMI, the protocol invoked the trial intervention after successful culprit-artery PCI and only in patients who had an artery amenable to PCI (and that was appropriately interpreted to be ‘at that time’).
SEMI	NEG	PMC5256395.xml	S148	Discussion	NEG	These trials should provide meaningful evidence to inform clinicians and practice guidelines on the optimal management of STEMI patients with MVD.
SEMI	POS	PMC5256395.xml	S150	Limitations	POS	The PRAMI CMR substudy involved a limited proportion of the total number of participants in the main trial PRAMI trial, reflecting the fact that two of the six centres participated in the CMR study.
SEMI	POS	PMC5256395.xml	S151	Limitations	POS	Further studies are warranted.
SEMI	POS	PMC5256395.xml	S152	Limitations	POS	The distributions of some of the characteristics of participants in the substudy, for example, anterior infarct location, departs from those of the main trial population.
SEMI	POS	PMC5256395.xml	S153	Limitations	POS	The number of clinical events in the substudy is lower than in the main trial.
SEMI	POS	PMC5256395.xml	S154	Limitations	POS	Because of changes in the availability of oedema imaging methods, two T2-weighted CMR methods were used during the lifetime of the project, making quantitative assessment of area-at-risk and myocardial salvage not feasible.
SEMI	POS	PMC5256395.xml	S155	Limitations	POS	Two of the patients did not have late gadolinium CMR imaging (one in the culprit-only PCI group and one in the preventive PCI group).
SEMI	POS	PMC5256395.xml	S156	Limitations	POS	Measurement of cardiac biomarkers (eg, serial troponin testing) was not part of the PRAMI trial protocol.
SEMI	POS	PMC5256395.xml	S157	Limitations	POS	There was heterogeneity in the duration of follow-up due to logistical reasons.
SEMI	NEG	PMC5256396.xml	S3		NEG	This review uses national datasets with multiple years of data to present secular trends in mortality, morbidity, and treatment for all CVD and specific subtypes within the UK.
SEMI	NEG	PMC5256396.xml	S34		NEG	Trends in hospital admissions, prevalence, and treatment data are reported from the earliest year available.
SEMI	NEG	PMC5256396.xml	S40		NEG	The Quality and Outcomes Framework (QOF) is collected annually through general practice records.
SEMI	NEG	PMC5256396.xml	S52		NEG	For the UK, total CVD mortality declined by 70% between 1979 and 2013, CHD mortality decreased by 72%, and mortality from stroke decreased by 71% between 1979 and 2013 (data available in online supplementary files).
SEMI	NEG	PMC5256396.xml	S89		NEG	Data for Scotland are available from 2009/2010 and show a 3% increase in CHD admissions and a 14% decrease in admissions for stroke during this period.
SEMI	NEG	PMC5256396.xml	S91		NEG	Stroke admissions in Northern Ireland decreased by 31%, which equates to around 1500 fewer admissions during this period, split fairly evenly between men and women.
SEMI	NEG	PMC5256396.xml	S113		NEG	The age-specific trends presented in figure 2 indicate an increase in CVD prevalence in only the older age groups over the past 20 years, but it is feasible that this trend is driven more by stroke prevalence than CHD prevalence.
SEMI	NEG	PMC5256396.xml	S139		NEG	However, it is important to note that these data do not account for increases in population, which are also likely to be a significant contributing factor.
SEMI	POS	PMC5256396.xml	S140		POS	This review on trends in the burden of CVD, CHD, and stroke aimed to include the best available data; there are, however, a number of weaknesses.
SEMI	POS	PMC5256396.xml	S141		POS	QOF data may be subject to changes in clinical case finding by general practitioners or differences in clinical coding practices.12
SEMI	POS	PMC5256396.xml	S142		POS	Other sources of prevalence data such as the Clinical Practice Research Database may have similar issues, although this dataset only samples 7% of the UK population.13
SEMI	POS	PMC5256396.xml	S143		POS	Prevalence reports from surveys face problems of accurately recalling both the type and date of diagnoses.
SEMI	POS	PMC5256396.xml	S144		POS	Ideally we would have reported sex-specific trends in prevalence for all data but QOF data are not available by sex.
SEMI	POS	PMC5256396.xml	S145		POS	Finished consultant episodes (both ordinary admissions and day cases) are a proxy for incidence as they do not count people who died before reaching hospital and do not distinguish between people with a first event or a recurring event.
SEMI	POS	PMC5256396.xml	S146		POS	We were also unable to provide age-standardised hospital admission rates as these data were not available by age group.
SEMI	POS	PMC5256396.xml	S147		POS	Consequently, both hospital admissions and all treatment trends do not take account of the increase in population over time.
SEMI	POS	PMC5256396.xml	S148		POS	Prescriptions data include prescriptions that may have been provided as secondary prevention for people identified as being at high risk for a CVD event; therefore this should be noted when using the data as a measure of existing burden.
SEMI	NEG	PMC5256396.xml	S149		NEG	The strengths of this review are that we present the first long-term age-standardised trends in CVD, CHD, and stroke using the 2013 ESP.
SEMI	NEG	PMC5256401.xml	S23		NEG	The polysaccharide capsule is a major virulence factor contributing to bacterial evasion of phagocytic clearance.10
SEMI	NEG	PMC5256401.xml	S27		NEG	Though 30–70% of the newborns of GBS colonised women are themselves colonised at birth, only 1–3% go on to develop EOD.12 13 16
SEMI	NEG	PMC5256401.xml	S73		NEG	As a result, the incidence of GBS EOD has declined dramatically, from 1.7 cases per 1000 live births in the early 1990s6 to 0.27 cases per 1000 live births by 2014.50
SEMI	NEG	PMC5256401.xml	S76		NEG	Several countries adopt a strategy to implement IAP when some or all of these risks are identified.
SEMI	NEG	PMC5256402.xml	S14	Objective	NEG	The increased odds of obesity in those who attended specialist services (relative to non-CFS in ALSPAC) was apparent at both 13 years (OR: 2.31 (1.54 to 3.48)) and 16 years, with a greater likelihood observed at 16 years (OR: 4.07 (2.04 to 8.11)).
SEMI	NEG	PMC5256402.xml	S26	Introduction	NEG	Little research has been conducted investigating the relationship between chronic fatigue syndrome/myalgic encephalomyelitis (CFS/ME) and obesity, especially in adolescents.
SEMI	NEG	PMC5256402.xml	S27	Introduction	NEG	The few cross-sectional studies which have been conducted have provided conflicting findings,1–4 while a large longitudinal study found no association between obesity at 10 years and self-reported CFS diagnosis by the age of 30 years.5
SEMI	NEG	PMC5256402.xml	S82	Results	NEG	Those classified as CFS/ME at 13 years also had a higher level of life difficulties at age 11 years, as measured by the Strengths and Difficulties Questionnaire (difference in means: 6.30; 95% CI 3.61 to 8.90).
SEMI	POS	PMC5256402.xml	S111	Discussion	POS	As mentioned previously, the cross-sectional nature of the study design limits our ability to make any causal conclusions.
SEMI	POS	PMC5256402.xml	S112	Discussion	POS	Furthermore, as the specialist service data are primarily a clinical data set and thus limited with regard to the amount of covariates collected and with the covariate data which were collected being different to those in ALSPAC, we were unable to adjust for a range of putative confounders of the association between CFS and obesity (eg, maternal and child depression and anxiety, socioeconomic status, sleep patterns, etc).
SEMI	POS	PMC5256402.xml	S113	Discussion	POS	However, the use of MI to address missing data due to loss to follow-up means we have likely removed some of the bias introduced by loss to follow-up (ie, we have shown previously that loss to follow-up is predicted by variables which are also predictive of CFS and obesity, eg, socioeconomic status).
SEMI	POS	PMC5256402.xml	S114	Discussion	POS	Furthermore, the use of MI allows analyses to be conducted on a much larger sample size, with the consequence of more precise parameter estimates.
SEMI	NEG	PMC5256403.xml	S38	Methods	NEG	A prospective, cross-sectional, observational, blinded, convenience study was conducted at the Children's Hospital at Westmead Paediatric Emergency Department (PED) in Sydney, Australia, from January to March 2015.
SEMI	NEG	PMC5256403.xml	S57	Methods	NEG	Calibrated scales were used for patients capable of standing (AND HV-150 KA1, Colonial weighing, Campbellfield, Australia) and a supine scale for infants (SECA Mod 727, Hamburg, Germany).
SEMI	NEG	PMC5256403.xml	S92	Discussion	NEG	With the age-based tools, there was very little difference between limits of agreement or mean difference, suggesting similar accuracy and precision.
SEMI	NEG	PMC5256403.xml	S95	Discussion	NEG	For the age group of 11–14 years, the mean difference of −0.1 kg, the narrow 95% CIs of −2.0 to 1.8, and the relatively narrow limits of agreement of −11 to 10.9 contrast with the other methods and show its utility in the older aged children who have wider weight distributions.
SEMI	NEG	PMC5256404.xml	S70		NEG	Another functional marker of AKI is Cys-C, which is a protease inhibitor produced at a constant rate by most nucleated cell types, whose elimination is almost exclusively via glomerular filtration.
SEMI	NEG	PMC5256404.xml	S91		NEG	Kashani et al performed a multicentre study in critically ill adults and found that urinary insulin-like growth factor binding protein 7 (IGFBP-7) and tissue inhibitor of metalloproteinase (TIMP)-2 (both are inducers of G1 cell cycle arrest) were the best performing biomarkers for AKI from an extensive list of 340 candidate biomarkers (including KIM-1, NGAL, IL-18, Cys-C and L-FABP).
SEMI	NEG	PMC5256404.xml	S104		NEG	Indeed the early diagnosis and management of AKI decreases mortality and long-term morbidity and appropriate early consultation with nephrology has been shown to improve renal survival and long-term outcome.31
SEMI	NEG	PMC5256404.xml	S137		NEG	Risk stratification coupled with a panel of AKI biomarkers will improve future detection of AKI, however paediatric validation studies in mixed patient cohorts are required.
SEMI	NEG	PMC5256416.xml	S7	Objective	NEG	The children were randomly selected from the total list of neonates screened in 2008, 2009 and 2010 by the Brussels newborn screening centre.

SEMI	NEG	PMC5256416.xml	S92	Results	NEG	The mean total motor score was −0.03 (1.1 (SD), −3.5–2.11 (min–max)), the mean objective motor score was 0.2 (1.1 (SD), −3.7–1.7 (min–max)), the mean subjective motor score was 0.28 (1.1 (SD), −2.9–2.5 (min–max)).
SEMI	NEG	PMC5256416.xml	S94	Results	NEG	The results are shown in tables 2 and 3.
SEMI	POS	PMC5256416.xml	S106	Discussion	POS	To our knowledge, only two studies have investigated psychomotor performance of children born with an elevated TSH and those had several limitations.

SEMI	POS	PMC5256416.xml	S108	Discussion	POS	They found that preterm newborns with a neonatal TSH value above 4.3 mIU/L had a suboptimal motor outcome at 18 months.21
SEMI	POS	PMC5256416.xml	S109	Discussion	POS	As preterm birth is known to increase TSH levels and to be related to suboptimal motor outcome22 the results of this study are not applicable to children born at term.
SEMI	POS	PMC5256416.xml	S110	Discussion	POS	The second study is an Iranian research which assessed the effect of transient neonatal hyperthyrotropinaemia (TNH) on psychomotor performance with Bender-Gestalt test on a sample of children 9 years of age.20
SEMI	POS	PMC5256416.xml	S111	Discussion	POS	They evaluated 18 children with TNH in comparison with 19 children without thyroid problems.
SEMI	POS	PMC5256416.xml	S112	Discussion	POS	They found no significant difference in psychomotor scores between the two groups.
SEMI	POS	PMC5256416.xml	S113	Discussion	POS	In addition to its very small sample size and to the lack of control of covariates, the results of this study are not comparable to those of the present study because children had much higher TSH values (23.4±8.3) than those included in the present study.
SEMI	NEG	PMC5256416.xml	S119	Discussion	NEG	The present study has assessed psychomotor outcomes of children born at term with elevated TSH at birth with the exclusion of children of low birth weight and infants with congenital hypothyroidism (>15 mIU/L).
SEMI	NEG	PMC5256416.xml	S131	Discussion	NEG	Indeed, several studies have shown that percentage of TSH >5 mIU/L collected after birth has failed to detect mild iodine deficiency.32–34
SEMI	NEG	PMC5256417.xml	S15	Background	NEG	Season of birth and region of birth are independently and jointly associated with increased risk of developing CD during the first 15 years of life.
SEMI	NEG	PMC5256417.xml	S77	Study findings	NEG	In the remaining months of June to November, the incidence rate appeared to drop aside from an increase in August.
SEMI	NEG	PMC5256417.xml	S131	Conclusion	NEG	We have confirmed a statistically significant effect of season of birth on the risk of being diagnosed with CD during childhood with the highest CD risk if born in south Sweden.
SEMI	NEG	PMC5256417.xml	S132	Conclusion	NEG	Viral infections are the strongest possible risk factor in favour of our findings, although the role of vitamin D during pregnancy is still plausible.
SEMI	NEG	PMC5257290.xml	S5	BACKGROUND	NEG	However, the subset of patients who will benefit from repeat resection in this setting remains ill defined.
SEMI	NEG	PMC5259948.xml	S16	Background	NEG	For almost 96% of the subjects this subtyping was accurate.
SEMI	NEG	PMC5259948.xml	S28	Background	NEG	It has also been commented, that the selection of variables in the previous studies has been wide and diverse [13].
SEMI	NEG	PMC5259948.xml	S70	Methods	NEG	We applied latent class analysis (LCA), a method used to classify observations into discrete, mutually exclusive classes on the basis of categorical manifest variables [26, 27].
SEMI	NEG	PMC5259948.xml	S157	Discussion	NEG	Thus, our approach provides a new alternative method for identifying subtypes of asthma that is more easily applicable for clinical work, especially in primary care settings with limited resources.
SEMI	NEG	PMC5259979.xml	S123	Discussion	NEG	This strong correlation with comorbidities, particularly with renal failure, partly explains the good association with the pneumonia risk scores.
SEMI	NEG	PMC5259979.xml	S129	Discussion	NEG	Two earlier studies found that a lower ratio of arginine to ADMA is a more sensitive risk marker for vascular dysfunction and mortality in shock patients than ADMA alone [21, 22].
SEMI	NEG	PMC5259979.xml	S154	Discussion	NEG	We also did not measure NO levels and so cannot be sure that our conclusions are complete.
SEMI	NEG	PMC5259979.xml	S155	Discussion	NEG	Finally, we did not have a complete marker set available for all patients due to low blood specimen volume.
SEMI	NEG	PMC5260037.xml	S11	Background	NEG	Lower concentrations of NAC (<1 μM) did not modulate the bronchial oxidative imbalance.
SEMI	NEG	PMC5260037.xml	S28	Background	NEG	LPS, also called endotoxin, is a major pro-inflammatory glycolipid component of the outer cell membrane of Gram-negative bacteria associated with the development and/or progression of many types of lung diseases including COPD [10].

SEMI	NEG	PMC5260037.xml	S151	Discussion	NEG	Intriguingly, our study confirms that very low concentrations of NKA might play a pivotal role in fine-tuning BHR in human tissues.
SEMI	NEG	PMC5260083.xml	S5	Background	NEG	The NR family was recently associated with allergic diseases, but the role of RXRs in allergen-induced airway responses is not well defined.
SEMI	NEG	PMC5260083.xml	S129	Results	NEG	Treatment with NEt-4IB significantly reduced the number of PAS-positive cells per millimeter of basement membrane (Fig. 1D).
SEMI	NEG	PMC5260083.xml	S137	Results	NEG	NO inhibitors block eosinophil recruitment in the lungs [32].
SEMI	NEG	PMC5260083.xml	S181	Discussion	NEG	Furthermore, the numbers of CD11b+ cells which are recognized as monocytes/macrophages and to a lower extent on granulocytes, NK cells, and a subset of dendritic cells in the lung were significantly lower in NEt-4IB treated mice.
SEMI	NEG	PMC5260146.xml	S6	OBJECTIVE	NEG	Analyses focused on sibling issues and the strategies families use to address these issues.
SEMI	NEG	PMC5262534.xml	S8	Purpose	NEG	The association of incident (new) use of short-acting nitrate formulations (nitroglycerin sublingual/spray/ointment or ISDN injection/sprays) with incident (new-onset) hip fracture risk was examined by plotting Kaplan-Maier curves and calculating Hazard ratios (HR) using Cox proportional hazards regression models.
SEMI	NEG	PMC5264210.xml	S14	Objectives	NEG	CZP+dose-optimised MTX treatment of DMARD-naïve early RA resulted in significantly more patients achieving sREM and sLDA, improved physical function and inhibited structural damage compared with PBO+dose-optimised MTX.
SEMI	NEG	PMC5264210.xml	S20	Introduction	NEG	Certolizumab pegol (CZP) is a PEGylated, Fc-free anti-TNF.
SEMI	NEG	PMC5264210.xml	S49	Methods	NEG	Hypothesis testing was performed on Week 52 data in a hierarchical manner starting with sREM, followed by the secondary endpoints in the following order: sLDA, ACR50, change from baseline (CFB) in the Health Assessment Questionnaire-Disability Index (HAQ-DI) and CFB in the van der Heijde modified total Sharp score (mTSS).
SEMI	NEG	PMC5264210.xml	S117	Discussion	NEG	The analysis of radiographic data in C-EARLY demonstrates that CZP+MTX therapy can inhibit structural damage significantly more than MTX alone—the percentage of patients with radiographic non-progression was significantly higher in the CZP+MTX group compared with the PBO+MTX group.
SEMI	NEG	PMC5264211.xml	S13	Objective	NEG	When onset of treatment with tanezumab was delayed to 3–8 weeks after MMT surgery, there was no increase in cartilage damage.
SEMI	NEG	PMC5264211.xml	S19	Introduction	NEG	Knee osteoarthritis (OA) is a condition characterised by pain, inflammation and functional disability.1
SEMI	NEG	PMC5264211.xml	S28	Introduction	NEG	A retrospective analysis of the data suggested ways to mitigate this risk, and based on these data the clinical hold was lifted to allow further trials to test these risk mitigation approaches.17–20
SEMI	NEG	PMC5264211.xml	S69	Methods	NEG	Cortical and cancellous bone of the proximal metaphysis were scanned and analysed in an ROI on 100 consecutive slices 1 mm below the growth plate with a thickness of 1.0 mm that best represented the central metaphysis segment.
SEMI	NEG	PMC5264213.xml	S24	Introduction	NEG	While PEGylation has been shown to reduce ADAbs in some proteins,6 it may increase it in others.7
SEMI	NEG	PMC5264213.xml	S73	Results	NEG	There was a trend for higher certolizumab levels (>23–24 μg/mL) to be associated with improvement in DAS28 from baseline.
SEMI	NEG	PMC5264213.xml	S92	Discussion	NEG	However, in contrast to other biologics, ADAbs against certolizumab may be detected more easily even in the presence of drug.
SEMI	NEG	PMC5264213.xml	S104	Discussion	NEG	A low certolizumab drug level in the absence of ADAb formation may prompt a discussion with the patient regarding reasons for non-adherence, also shown to be important in adalimumab-treated patients.9
SEMI	NEG	PMC5264214.xml	S36	Methods	NEG	Patients not receiving a csDMARD at the time of entry had to have failure of, inability to tolerate, or contraindication to treatment with a csDMARD documented by the investigator in the patient's history.
SEMI	NEG	PMC5264214.xml	S66	Methods	NEG	Radiographs were obtained upon study discontinuation if >12 weeks had elapsed since the last prior radiograph.
SEMI	NEG	PMC5264214.xml	S75	Methods	NEG	An independent cardiovascular evaluation committee adjudicated potential cardiovascular events.
SEMI	NEG	PMC5264214.xml	S105	Results	NEG	Most patients who completed week 24 entered the long-term extension study.
SEMI	NEG	PMC5264215.xml	S3	Objective	NEG	To evaluate the efficacy of canakinumab, a high-affinity human monoclonal anti-interleukin-1β antibody, in inducing complete or almost complete responses in patients with active tumour necrosis factor receptor-associated periodic syndrome (TRAPS).
SEMI	NEG	PMC5264215.xml	S11	Objective	NEG	All patients relapsed after canakinumab was withdrawn; median time to relapse 91.5 days (95% CI 65 to 117 days).
SEMI	NEG	PMC5264215.xml	S51	Methods	NEG	The PGA was developed based upon discussions with the principal investigators and in accordance with the same instrument used previously in canakinumab trials in CAPS;19 the PGA was not validated for use in TRAPS.
SEMI	NEG	PMC5264215.xml	S56	Methods	NEG	Complete response was defined as clinical remission (PGA score ≤1) with full serological remission (CRP <10 mg/L and/or SAA <10 mg/L), and almost complete response was defined as clinical remission with partial serological remission (≥70% reduction of baseline CRP and/or SAA).
SEMI	NEG	PMC5264217.xml	S8	Objectives	NEG	Control participants received saline irrigation only.
SEMI	NEG	PMC5264217.xml	S17	Objectives	NEG	9 of 10 manufactured products met quality control release criteria; acceptability of the protocol by participants was high.
SEMI	NEG	PMC5264217.xml	S95	Results	NEG	The 10×106 tolDC cohort contained only one patient with RA, whereas the lower dose cohorts contained three each.
SEMI	NEG	PMC5264217.xml	S123	Results	NEG	All AEs were assessed as mild or moderate with no evidence of a dose–response relationship.
SEMI	NEG	PMC5264219.xml	S34	Methods	NEG	10.1136/annrheumdis-2016-209709.supp1
SEMI	NEG	PMC5264219.xml	S37	Methods	NEG	Randomisation was performed centrally via an interactive voice response system based on a computer-generated randomisation code, with stratification by country and by prior/current/no use of conventional (non-biologic) disease-modifying antirheumatic drugs (cDMARDs).
SEMI	NEG	PMC5264219.xml	S62	Methods	NEG	To control the overall type I error rate at a two-sided α level of 0.05, a multiplicity-controlled analysis was used for the primary end point and the six predetermined secondary end points.
SEMI	NEG	PMC5264219.xml	S129	Discussion	NEG	A numerically greater proportion of patients receiving IXEQ2W achieved, for many end points, greater efficacy at week 24 compared with IXEQ4W.
SEMI	NEG	PMC5264222.xml	S30	Introduction	NEG	Similar structural, physicochemical and biological activities of SB4 and ETN have been shown using state-of-the-art analytical methods including peptide mapping, TNF-α binding assay and TNF-α neutralisation cell-based assay.
SEMI	NEG	PMC5264222.xml	S60	Methods	NEG	Sample size was determined using the historical data for the equivalence test.
SEMI	NEG	PMC5264222.xml	S74	Methods	NEG	The analyses were performed using SAS V.9
SEMI	NEG	PMC5264222.xml	S134	Discussion	NEG	It has not been shown that L-arginine is associated with increased risk of ISR; however, we cannot preclude the sole difference in formulation (absence of L-arginine) as the cause of ISR.
SEMI	NEG	PMC5264225.xml	S54	Results	NEG	Pan-HDACi are broad-acting anti-inflammatory agents that are beneficial in several disease models.24
SEMI	NEG	PMC5264225.xml	S90	Results	NEG	We conclude that while HDAC3 strongly regulates STAT1 activity in RA FLS, this does not occur via a direct acetylation event.
SEMI	NEG	PMC5264225.xml	S105	Discussion	NEG	Indeed, distinct DNA methylome signatures and elevated HDAC expression have been observed in long-term cultured RA FLS compared with osteoarthritis (OA) FLS,34 35 and pharmacological inhibition of proteins reading or modifying epigenetic marks was shown to prevent the inflammatory activation of RA FLS.5 36
SEMI	NEG	PMC5264225.xml	S116	Discussion	NEG	On the other hand, HDAC6 plays a role in immunological tolerance in macrophages44 45 and its deficiency enhances regulatory T cells (Tregs) suppressive functions.46
SEMI	NEG	PMC5264226.xml	S24	Introduction	NEG	In the β-catenin-dependent (or canonical WNT) pathway, engagement of WNTs with their receptors results in the accumulation and nuclear translocation of β-catenin and transcriptional activation of target genes.12
SEMI	NEG	PMC5264226.xml	S82	Results	NEG	The histomorphometry is described in online supplementary figure S4.
SEMI	NEG	PMC5264226.xml	S83	Results	NEG	An independent experiment in mice at the fifth backcross into the 129/Sv phenotype yielded similar results (data not shown).
SEMI	NEG	PMC5264226.xml	S144	Discussion	NEG	This modality of signalling was not limited to the articular cartilage and OA but was extended to biological contexts as remote as Xenopus development.
SEMI	NEG	PMC5264229.xml	S6	Objectives	NEG	Patients with moderate to severe RA despite methotrexate therapy were randomised in a 1:1 ratio to receive either SB2 or INF of 3 mg/kg.
SEMI	NEG	PMC5264229.xml	S13	Objectives	NEG	Other efficacy outcomes such as ACR50/70, disease activity score measured by 28 joints and European League against Rheumatism response were similar between SB2 and INF.
SEMI	NEG	PMC5264229.xml	S38	Patients and methods	NEG	Patients had to take MTX for at least 6 months and had to be under a stable dose for at least 4 weeks before randomisation.
SEMI	NEG	PMC5264229.xml	S115	Results	NEG	Finally, the ACR20 response over time is shown in figure 3.
SEMI	NEG	PMC5264234.xml	S19	Objective	NEG	Genetic deletion or pharmacological blockade of TRPC5 results in an enhancement in joint inflammation and hyperalgesia.
SEMI	NEG	PMC5264234.xml	S82	Results	NEG	Results demonstrated a significant induction in the expression of these enzymes in the ipsilateral synovium of TRPC5 KO mice (figure 3C).
SEMI	NEG	PMC5264234.xml	S128	Discussion	NEG	However, this remains to be investigated.
SEMI	NEG	PMC5264234.xml	S133	Discussion	NEG	In line with this, we show that in WT mice, synovial vascularisation was pronounced on day 7, but unchanged compared with the contralateral synovium by day 14.
SEMI	NEG	PMC5264306.xml	S30	Introduction	NEG	We performed an analysis of gene expression from patients in this study and age-matched healthy volunteers to characterise treatment-induced alterations.
SEMI	NEG	PMC5264306.xml	S86	Results	NEG	When the neutrophil count was included in the linear models described above, 52% of the canakinumab signature genes continued to be differentially expressed post-treatment with p<0.05.
SEMI	NEG	PMC5264306.xml	S126	Discussion	NEG	Many of these disease mechanisms were identified initially from studies conducted in monocytes and murine models.4
SEMI	NEG	PMC5264306.xml	S144	Discussion	NEG	Taken together, the present findings support a model in which IL-1β inhibition by canakinumab downregulates genes in the IL-1 signalling and other innate immunity pathways that are overexpressed in TRAPS.
SEMI	NEG	PMC5264670.xml	S4		NEG	While many acknowledge biases caused by poor study designs, in this article we argue that several valid designs using administrative data can produce strong findings, particularly the interrupted time series (ITS) design.

SEMI	NEG	PMC5264670.xml	S58		NEG	We hope the increasing use of this common and useful design is accompanied by an expanding acceptance of other strong non-experimental designs by medical journals and scholars.5
SEMI	NEG	PMC5264670.xml	S65		NEG	Research design is often missing in the medical curriculum.
SEMI	NEG	PMC5264674.xml	S57	METHODS	NEG	Raters met after the initial ratings, discussed any disagreements, and for each recommendation came to consensus on whether it should be included or not.
SEMI	NEG	PMC5264674.xml	S99	RESULTS	NEG	Similar patterns were observed for the CW recommendations (a) to avoid brain imaging studies (CT of MRI) in evaluation of simple syncope and (b) to avoid using antimicrobials to treat bacteriuria in older adults unless specific symptoms were present.
SEMI	NEG	PMC5264674.xml	S117	DISCUSSION	NEG	The most conspicuous finding of our surveys was the high rates of concern about patient acceptance of the five CW recommendations shown in Figure 3, which all focus on treatment of symptomatic conditions (sinusitis, insomnia/agitation/delirium) or imaging of symptomatic conditions (syncope, low back pain).
SEMI	NEG	PMC5264674.xml	S122	DISCUSSION	NEG	Unfortunately, such anticipatory concern could become a self-fulfilling prophecy.
SEMI	NEG	PMC5265976.xml	S25		NEG	Hiatt et al[3] simplified Michel classification by proposing a classification scheme with 6 arterial variants.
SEMI	NEG	PMC5265976.xml	S80		NEG	Lacking the required planning and expertise, the surgeon elected to perform a choledochojejunostomy rather than a PD.
SEMI	NEG	PMC5265976.xml	S90		NEG	Accidental injury or ligation of hepatic arteries may result in intraoperative bleeding and hepatobiliary ischemia, which is always associated with severe and costly morbidities.[11]
SEMI	NEG	PMC5265976.xml	S101		NEG	An en bloc resection, transaction, and reconstruction may be performed by primary anastomosis or through implantation at a suitable arterial site in patients whose arteries are invaded or encased by their tumors.[14]

SEMI	NEG	PMC5265977.xml	S27	Introduction	NEG	The dissected corneas were subjected to a protocol of ultracentrifugation to obtain synaptosomes of sensory nerve terminals.
SEMI	NEG	PMC5265977.xml	S47	Materials and methods	NEG	This was thereafter cold centrifuged at increasing speeds of 1000 to 10,000 g to obtain a clear supernatant and a largely epithelial pellet.
SEMI	NEG	PMC5265977.xml	S90	Materials and methods	NEG	A total of 30 μL of luciferin–luciferase reagent (ATP luminescence assay, Perkin Elmers, Waltham, MA) was added to a well, followed by detection of the optical density of luminescence (Luminoskan Ascent Microplate Luminometer, Thermo Scientific, Waltham, MA, USA).

SEMI	NEG	PMC5265978.xml	S67	Abstract	NEG	It appeared that the prefrontal cortex and thalamus, which showed increased neural connectivity, contributed to recovery from a VS to an MCS in this patient.
SEMI	NEG	PMC5265978.xml	S41	Case report	NEG	Affine multiscale 2-dimensional registration was used for correction of head motion effect and image distortion due to eddy current.
SEMI	NEG	PMC5265978.xml	S69	Discussion	NEG	However, the limitation of DTT should be considered: it may underestimate the fiber tracts due to regions of fiber complexity and crossing.[15]
SEMI	NEG	PMC5265979.xml	S15	Abstract	NEG	It is quite unfortunate for this patient to have a poor prognosis due to a delayed diagnosis and an improper management.
SEMI	NEG	PMC5265979.xml	S56	Case presentation	NEG	The power of the proximal lower limbs gradually increased to grade 2/5.
SEMI	NEG	PMC5265979.xml	S78	Discussion	NEG	This case highlights the need to consider the possibility of a fishbone being the underlying cause in any case of unexplained back pain or mediastinum inflammatory process so that such condition can be diagnosed and treated in a timely manner.
SEMI	NEG	PMC5265979.xml	S97	Discussion	NEG	In this case, antibiotics of broad-spectrum had been used on the time of admission without cultivating the causative microorganism from blood and abscess, which, quite likely, relates to the negative results of the subsequently cultural tests.
SEMI	NEG	PMC5265980.xml	S20		NEG	In Korea, the direct medical cost for femur fracture treatment was $3000 USD during the period from 2002 to 2004.[7] When we consider the Korean gross domestic product per capita (about $15,000 USD during this period), the treatment cost is more than 20% of total income.
SEMI	NEG	PMC5265980.xml	S40		NEG	From the 9031 patients with a primary diagnosis of femur fracture between 2002 and 2013, we excluded 1117 patients with preexisting femur fracture history from January 2002 to December 2003 and 2473 patients who were aged under 65 years at initial diagnosis.
SEMI	NEG	PMC5265980.xml	S43		NEG	Then, we censored them at the end of year with the last medical record.
SEMI	NEG	PMC5265980.xml	S47		NEG	Age group is divided into 2 categories, aged below 75 years and 75 years or over.
SEMI	NEG	PMC5265980.xml	S51		NEG	We adjusted the Charlson Comorbidity Index (CCI) for the potential effect of preexisting medication conditions.[15]
SEMI	NEG	PMC5265980.xml	S56		NEG	In addition, we included neurologic disorders such as parkinsonism, dementia, and others related to aging and movement because they are well known risk factors to femur fracture.
SEMI	NEG	PMC5265980.xml	S67		NEG	The NHI premium was used as a proxy measure of precise income because it is proportional to monthly income, including earnings and capital gains.
SEMI	NEG	PMC5265980.xml	S74		NEG	We also set another outcome variable of mortality, defined as all-cause mortality, after the initial diagnosis of femur fracture.
SEMI	NEG	PMC5265980.xml	S92		NEG	A total number of 5441 patients were newly diagnosed with femur fractures from 2004 to 2013 and were enrolled in this study.
SEMI	NEG	PMC5265980.xml	S156		NEG	However, this previous Korean study did not have a distinguishable individual income variable, which our study has.
SEMI	POS	PMC5265980.xml	S166		POS	This study has several limitations.
SEMI	POS	PMC5265980.xml	S167		POS	First, we could not adjust for the daily activities for each patient, such as activities of daily living or instrumental activities of daily living.
SEMI	POS	PMC5265980.xml	S168		POS	These are related to the incidence of femur fracture and overall mortality rate in the elderly population.
SEMI	POS	PMC5265980.xml	S169		POS	Nevertheless, we took into account the other medical conditions and general health of all participants using the CCI and the medical history of neurodegenerative disorders, which are among the most well known predictors for survival among femur-fracture patients.
SEMI	POS	PMC5265980.xml	S170		POS	Second, there are some issues with using administrative claim data.
SEMI	POS	PMC5265980.xml	S171		POS	The reliance on the ICD-10 code for femur fracture might yield some misclassification due to the unavoidable miscoding in claim data, whether intended or unintentional.
SEMI	POS	PMC5265980.xml	S172		POS	However, through the efforts of both the government and hospitals, nearly 70% of primary, secondary, and tertiary diagnosis codes from claims records coincide with those from medical records in hospitals.[33]
SEMI	POS	PMC5265980.xml	S173		POS	Third, we could not account for femur-fracture patients who did not use health facilities in spite of the fracture.
SEMI	POS	PMC5265980.xml	S174		POS	However, since femur fracture is life threatening, it was assumed that virtually all femur-fracture patients visited healthcare facilities.
SEMI	POS	PMC5265980.xml	S175		POS	Finally, we did not clearly suggest the higher HR in middle-income than another in high-income patients, although it was not statistically meaningful.
SEMI	POS	PMC5265980.xml	S176		POS	One possible hypothesis is that the adjusted variables are not enough to control different characteristics across 3 income groups.
SEMI	POS	PMC5265980.xml	S177		POS	However, we still need some further investigations for this result.
SEMI	NEG	PMC5265980.xml	S178		NEG	In spite of these limitations, our study had a number of key strengths.
SEMI	NEG	PMC5265980.xml	S183		NEG	Fourth, we used survival and medical history data from national statistics and the NHI, which are the most accurate survival and disease databases.
SEMI	NEG	PMC5265981.xml	S17	Abstract	NEG	Several challenges must be met when organizing the medical care of this growing number of patients, when delivering surgery through qualified centers while assuring the quality of long-term follow-up for all patients.
SEMI	NEG	PMC5265981.xml	S78	Results	NEG	A total of 41,648 patients underwent a bariatric procedure in 2013, including 114 patients younger than 18 years (Table 1).
SEMI	NEG	PMC5265981.xml	S121	Discussion	NEG	Patients who fail to comply with this mandatory preoperative program will have no access to bariatric procedure.
SEMI	NEG	PMC5265981.xml	S125	Discussion	NEG	Patients who undergo bariatric surgery are likely to have high universal health insurance coverage for low-income patients (15.6% and up to 23% of teenagers).
SEMI	NEG	PMC5265981.xml	S138	Discussion	NEG	Since very few robust long-term data and almost no randomized evidence are available in the literature for this age group, there is an urgent need to set up national registries and long-term follow-up for this specific population.
SEMI	POS	PMC5265981.xml	S144	Discussion	POS	However, the present study presents a number of limitations.
SEMI	POS	PMC5265981.xml	S145	Discussion	POS	First, as the present study was based on a large administrative dataset, some data may be invalid or missing.
SEMI	POS	PMC5265981.xml	S146	Discussion	POS	However, several previous publications have demonstrated the value of using the French National Health Insurance Information System for epidemiological research in different contexts.[13,14]
SEMI	POS	PMC5265981.xml	S147	Discussion	POS	Second, some administrative data are not sufficiently precise.

SEMI	NEG	PMC5265986.xml	S86	Results	NEG	In degenerative MR, the lesions were prolapse/flail of P2 segment in 7 patients (33.3%), of P3 in 3 patients (14.3%), of A2 in 2 patients (9.6%), and multisegment in 9 patients (42.8%).
SEMI	NEG	PMC5265986.xml	S87	Results	NEG	In 15 control subjects without MV structural disease, the echocardiographic evaluation was performed to assess potential cardioembolic source (n = 13) or to exclude endocarditis (n = 2).
SEMI	NEG	PMC5265986.xml	S94	Results	NEG	The automated software analysis in FMR and in degenerative disease MR showed a significant increase in annular size when compared to that in controls (859.75 and 801.83 vs 607.78 mm2; P = 0.002) during systole and (1040.60 vs.
SEMI	NEG	PMC5265986.xml	S104	Results	NEG	Interestingly, there was no significant difference in change of the anteroposterior diameter (19.49% vs 24.73%; P = 0.059).
SEMI	NEG	PMC5265986.xml	S111	Results	NEG	Manual adjustment when required slightly increased the analysis time in comparison with fully automated eSie Valves software (<1 minute in all cases).
SEMI	POS	PMC5265986.xml	S148	Discussion	POS	The present work mainly focused on the evaluation of the MA as assessed by the automatic software in distinguishing between OMR and FMR.
SEMI	POS	PMC5265986.xml	S149	Discussion	POS	However, the software provides a handful number of different parameters on the several components of the MV.
SEMI	POS	PMC5265986.xml	S150	Discussion	POS	Thus, it remains open to assess other MV components as additional or surrogate to discern among different MR etiologies.
SEMI	POS	PMC5265986.xml	S151	Discussion	POS	It should also be pointed out that in the present study we did not compare software measurements with pathologic findings during cardiac surgery or with a gold standard imaging able to define a correct validation of the automatic software measurements.

SEMI	POS	PMC5265996.xml	S137	Discussion	POS	Second, although the subjects of the research were healthy people who underwent health examinations, they were people who chose a single health promotion center.
SEMI	POS	PMC5265996.xml	S138	Discussion	POS	Therefore, they cannot be assumed to represent the nutrition intake of all Koreans, which indicates a sample selection bias.
SEMI	POS	PMC5265996.xml	S139	Discussion	POS	In addition, as they are people who undergo health examinations regularly, they tend to be more interested in their health care than the average population and are well-educated about health care, leading to further differences in diet and exercise with an average Korean.
SEMI	POS	PMC5265996.xml	S140	Discussion	POS	Third, a survey on physical exercise, which is known as a strong confounding factor when evaluating nutritional risk factors, could not be properly adjusted in this study.
SEMI	POS	PMC5265996.xml	S141	Discussion	POS	Generally, people who are physically more active tend to eat healthier and be more interested in health; therefore, correcting for physical exercise level is important when analyzing correlations between diet and risk of disease.

SEMI	NEG	PMC5266003.xml	S154	Discussion	NEG	Therefore, ketamine may reduce the development of chronic postoperative pain via NMDA receptor blockade, which reduces wind-up and central sensitization.[11]
SEMI	NEG	PMC5266004.xml	S6	Abstract	NEG	Around 18 patients with GIST were investigated in which 9 patients received 300 mg/d imatinib.
SEMI	NEG	PMC5266004.xml	S21	Introduction	NEG	PK studies have suggested a rapid and nearly complete (98%) oral bioavailability of IM and the elimination half-life of ∼20 hours, thus allowing once-daily dosing.[7]

SEMI	POS	PMC5266047.xml	S106	Discussion	POS	First, the number of cases in our study was not large, leading to a small number of subjects for the subgroup analysis.
SEMI	POS	PMC5266047.xml	S107	Discussion	POS	These numbers were affected by our desire to exclude the impact of liver injury induced by other factors, such as alcoholic liver disease and NAFLD, and thus the nonsignificant findings with respect to the severity of liver disease may be a reflection of these low numbers.

SEMI	POS	PMC5266051.xml	S170	Discussion	POS	However, to the best of our knowledge, this is the first study to investigate the molecular characteristics of TSA, SSA, and PHP in Koreans.
SEMI	POS	PMC5266051.xml	S171	Discussion	POS	The sample size was not sufficient to fully conclude the methylation status of serrated lesions.
SEMI	POS	PMC5266051.xml	S172	Discussion	POS	In addition, the tubular adenomas were selected randomly, but not matched, and should be matched by sex and age to SSA or TSA in future studies.
SEMI	POS	PMC5266051.xml	S173	Discussion	POS	CpG island methylator phenotype analysis and microsatellite instability was not examined because extracted DNA was not enough.
SEMI	POS	PMC5266051.xml	S174	Discussion	POS	Instead, CD133 was used as a global DNA methylation marker.
SEMI	POS	PMC5266051.xml	S175	Discussion	POS	In addition, CD133 is a marker of the cancer stem cell population, and methylation of cancer stem cell-related Wnt target genes including CD133 may reflect poor prognosis in CRC.[36]

SEMI	NEG	PMC5266059.xml	S21		NEG	Whereas low body mass might be the result of previous weight loss due to disease and is associated with increased mortality,[5] especially in older individuals.[6]
SEMI	NEG	PMC5266059.xml	S31		NEG	Thus, it might be a more sensible approach to identify individuals following an unfavorable BMI trajectory instead of stratifying individuals based on their current BMI or short-term weight changes into risk groups.
SEMI	NEG	PMC5266059.xml	S80		NEG	This equals about 3 kg weight gain or loss within the 3 years from one measurement to the next for a 1.75 cm tall individual.
SEMI	NEG	PMC5266059.xml	S140		NEG	In older age, the class characterized by a plateau or increase followed by a decrease of BMI is associated with increased overall and diabetes mortality.

SEMI	NEG	PMC5266060.xml	S32	Introduction	NEG	Several studies revealed that the occurrence of mutations, specifically in the HN and SH regions (including in antigenic and immunogenic epitopes), transformed the vaccine strain into its wild type, and may have led to the development of postvaccination meningitis.[20]

SEMI	POS	PMC5266060.xml	S156	Discussion	POS	We also could not do whole genome sequencing for better analysis of mutations in the mumps virus genome, because of low sample concentration and budget limitations.
SEMI	POS	PMC5266060.xml	S157	Discussion	POS	It seems that this study cannot be applied to other populations in the Middle East because their mumps vaccination programme and coverage as well as the mumps virus strains that they use in their vaccines are unknown to us.
SEMI	POS	PMC5266060.xml	S158	Discussion	POS	The low number of mumps meningitis cases is due to the rarity of mumps virus infection in vaccinated patients, given that there is a vaccination programme against the mumps virus in Iran for several years, which has decreased mumps virus infection significantly.
SEMI	POS	PMC5266060.xml	S159	Discussion	POS	Therefore, further studies are required to sequence other regions of the 3 mumps genome, which were detected in this study.
SEMI	NEG	PMC5266061.xml	S23	Introduction	NEG	Therefore, the hypertriglyceridemic waist (HTGW) phenotype (defined as hypertriglyceridemia and elevated WC) was firstly proposed by Lemieux et al[11] and suggested to be a simple and inexpensive tool to predict cardiometabolic abnormalities in individuals with excess visceral adipose.[12,13]

SEMI	POS	PMC5266062.xml	S203	Conclusions	POS	Second, the study is based on an experience in a single referral center rather than in a population-based setting.
SEMI	POS	PMC5266062.xml	S204	Conclusions	POS	However, since almost all PWID with IE in the region are referred to our hospital the likelihood of missed SAE cases is small.
SEMI	POS	PMC5266062.xml	S205	Conclusions	POS	Hence, the study provides a fairly accurate overview of SAE related to intravenous drug use also on a population basis.
SEMI	POS	PMC5266062.xml	S206	Conclusions	POS	A strength of our study is the unique setting with a single referral center for PWID with serious infections in a defined geographical area, leading to inclusion of a large number of patients, and a high availability and quality of the medical records.
SEMI	NEG	PMC5266063.xml	S19		NEG	Diabetic complications are linked with disability and even death in patients with T2DM and thus constitute the main disease burden of T2DM.
SEMI	NEG	PMC5266063.xml	S20		NEG	Therefore, identifying patients at a high risk of developing complications is important.
SEMI	NEG	PMC5266063.xml	S44		NEG	In addition, we used 5 kg as the threshold for weight loss because previous studies showed that a weight loss of at least 5 kg was the standard value defining significant weight loss in patients with obesity[12] and weight loss >5 kg during the course of 1 year is an independent risk factor for 6-month mortality of nursing home residents.
SEMI	NEG	PMC5266063.xml	S82		NEG	This intervention weight loss with lifestyle change is beneficial for controlling the patient's blood glucose and blood lipids[15,16]; furthermore, postdiagnosis weight loss might impact the patient's psychological state and therefore improve their health-related quality of life.[17]
SEMI	POS	PMC5266063.xml	S93		POS	This study had several limitations.
SEMI	POS	PMC5266063.xml	S94		POS	Because the weight-loss information was based on recall, recall bias cannot be fully ruled out; however, the information was confirmed with patients and their relatives to ensure accuracy.
SEMI	POS	PMC5266063.xml	S95		POS	Second, our sample might not be completely representative of patients with T2DM in China because our hospital is one of the best hospitals in Zibo and the inpatients at our hospital show a higher frequency of diabetic complications; however, the representativeness of our sample should not substantially affect the internal validity of the study.
SEMI	POS	PMC5266063.xml	S96		POS	Finally, we could not examine the hazard ratio of weight loss with diabetic complications due to the lack of detailed information on the onset time of diabetic complications.
SEMI	NEG	PMC5266064.xml	S57	Methods	NEG	A mixed analysis of variance (3 × 4 design) was also applied to analyze the influence of 2 independent factors on anxiety and quality of life, namely, type of cosmetic breast surgery (breast augmentation, mastopexy, and breast reduction) and time (preoperative stage and at 1, 6, and 12 months postoperative).
SEMI	NEG	PMC5266064.xml	S62	Results	NEG	The 3 groups of women were homogeneous with regard to marital status (P = 0.077), education level (P = 0.509), and employment (P = 0.140).
SEMI	NEG	PMC5266064.xml	S87	Discussion	NEG	Therefore, the mastopexy group's vitality may wane in the immediate postoperative period (1 month) due to a higher rate of complications inherent in the surgical procedure, recovering considerably later (postoperative at 6 and 12 months), and favorably influencing the role-emotional dimension more strongly than in the other 2 groups (postoperative at 6 months).
SEMI	NEG	PMC5266064.xml	S88	Discussion	NEG	This could also explain the poorer quality of life experienced by women who had breast reduction, compared to the breast augmentation group, in the physical functioning and role-physical dimensions.
SEMI	NEG	PMC5266065.xml	S31	Methods	NEG	From these subjects, those confirmed as AD/MCI, DLB, or FTD were enrolled.
SEMI	NEG	PMC5266065.xml	S73	Results	NEG	Patients with AD/MCI were followed up for longer than those with DLB or FTD by a dementia expert (P = 0.054).
SEMI	NEG	PMC5266065.xml	S79	Results	NEG	However, true negative cases in AD/MCI and true positive cases in FTD were slightly decreased using 3D-SSP method.
SEMI	NEG	PMC5266065.xml	S119	Discussion	NEG	Another finding of this study was that the correction of misdiagnosis after 3D-SSP images was the greatest in AD/MCI (56%, Fig. 1), followed by DLB and FTD.
SEMI	NEG	PMC5266066.xml	S23	Introduction	NEG	Occasionally, patients present with large deformities that require more significant procedures.[2]
SEMI	NEG	PMC5266066.xml	S25	Introduction	NEG	Therefore, many patients who are treated with surgery will face pregnancy and delivery.
SEMI	NEG	PMC5266066.xml	S78	Discussion	NEG	Congenital vertebral anomalies have the potential to progress, so careful assessment and monitoring are essential, and early intervention may be desirable.[7]
SEMI	NEG	PMC5266066.xml	S117	Discussion	NEG	For female patients with congenital spinal deformity who wish to get pregnant, we suggest attempting sufficient fusion in the osteotomy zone, such as via anterior fixation support and reinforcement with cross-connection.
SEMI	NEG	PMC5266067.xml	S66		NEG	The primers for the first round amplification and the second round of X/ preCore region were PreC-os/ PreC-oa and PreC-is/ PreC-ia, respectively.
SEMI	NEG	PMC5266067.xml	S94		NEG	There was a significant decline in anti-HBs GMT in the 6 to 10-year-old group (vs <6-year-old, mean difference ratio 1.35; vs 10 to 14-year-old, mean difference ratio 1.31, respectively) correlated with the peak prevalence of viremia in this age group.
SEMI	NEG	PMC5266067.xml	S152		NEG	However, an increasing prevalence of genotype A2, especially in acute hepatitis B cases, has been noted in Japan since 1991,[29] and the investigation suggested a horizontal transmission pattern.[30]
SEMI	POS	PMC5266067.xml	S166		POS	This study has some limitations.
SEMI	POS	PMC5266067.xml	S167		POS	Because it was a cross-sectional study, the results represent a snapshot only; longitudinal data from these subjects are lacking.
SEMI	POS	PMC5266067.xml	S168		POS	Further, the HBV infection status of mothers was not determined in this study, which made determining the route of infection (mother-to-child transmission) speculative.
SEMI	NEG	PMC5266068.xml	S31	Methods	NEG	We reviewed electronic medical charts and constructed a retrospective cohort study from 2010 to 2012.
SEMI	NEG	PMC5266068.xml	S52	Methods	NEG	The mortality record was retrieved from the EMRs and classified into 3 groups; within 24 hours, 72 hours, and 28 days after admitting to ED.
SEMI	NEG	PMC5266068.xml	S89	Results	NEG	There were nearly 2/3 of all enrolled patients with clinically suspected sepsis met the SIRS criteria (N = 14,054, 69.6%).
SEMI	NEG	PMC5266068.xml	S91	Results	NEG	Among patients with confirmed bacteremia, the elderly patients tended to be less likely to present with tachycardia but more like to present with tachypnea (young: 28.8%, young-old: 36.5%, and old: 49.7%; P < 0.0001, Table 2).
SEMI	NEG	PMC5266068.xml	S97	Results	NEG	On the contrary, hypothermia (<36 °C) was associated negative blood culture results among the old patient groups (old group aOR: 0.68, 95% CI: 0.51–0.91, P = 0.01).
SEMI	NEG	PMC5266068.xml	S120	Discussion	NEG	It could also be possible that clinician would be more cautious to survey the possibility of bacteremia among the elderly in our ED.
SEMI	POS	PMC5266068.xml	S151	Limitation	POS	There were some limitations in our study.
SEMI	POS	PMC5266068.xml	S152	Limitation	POS	First, due to all the data were retrieved via the EMRs, there was incomplete information regarding patient sources and the prevalence of indwelling urinary catheter.
SEMI	POS	PMC5266068.xml	S153	Limitation	POS	Second, respiratory rate was counted by triage nurses visually and was not highly reliable, which could potentially contribute to its poor performance to predict bacteremia.
SEMI	POS	PMC5266068.xml	S154	Limitation	POS	Third, we may underestimate the prevalence of fever at the triage because patients may have antipyretic before visiting ED, which could also influence the performance of hyperthermia to predict bacteremia.
SEMI	POS	PMC5266068.xml	S155	Limitation	POS	Fourth, although we have attempted to adjust the potential confounders such as comorbidities, we caution the reader to generalize our results before comparing their own patient population.
SEMI	POS	PMC5266068.xml	S156	Limitation	POS	Lastly, although we included patients with infectious diseases and clinically suspected bacteremia as indicated by 2 sets of blood cultures ordered on physician's discretion and excluded patients who had cardiac arrest before ED visit and visited ED owing to traumatic injury, it is still possible that bacteremia is a secondary effect that associated with diseases and disorders accompanied with SIRS other than infections.
SEMI	NEG	PMC5266069.xml	S17	Introduction	NEG	Such facts seem to be captured by the expression “the Information Age,” which started in the late 20th century and has continued into the 21st century, and in which the flow of information has been achieved with the help of digitized storage, computers, and the internet.[2]
SEMI	NEG	PMC5266069.xml	S36	Methods	NEG	In all, 24 subjects (aged 19–26, average age 22.33, 10 females) participated.
SEMI	NEG	PMC5266069.xml	S57	Methods	NEG	These 4 measures became the variables used in the pathway model to explain the cognitive process of the reader in decision-making.

SEMI	NEG	PMC5266069.xml	S92	Results	NEG	Our model fitted the data well (χ2 = 0.86, df = 1, comparative fit index = 0.999, Tucker–Lewis index = 1.000, RMSEA <0.001), meaning that the model explained the cognitive decision-processing of readers upon reading the medical news articles.
SEMI	POS	PMC5266069.xml	S136	Discussion	POS	This study has some limitations.
SEMI	POS	PMC5266069.xml	S137	Discussion	POS	First, the sample size was small, and the participants recruited were within a narrow age range, which may have limited their interest in medicine.
SEMI	POS	PMC5266069.xml	S138	Discussion	POS	Second, because the study used direct questions to collect answers from readers, implicit impressions or responses were not considered.
SEMI	POS	PMC5266069.xml	S139	Discussion	POS	A single-item measure on the 4 domains may lack in reliability and validity in terms of psychometrics.
SEMI	POS	PMC5266069.xml	S140	Discussion	POS	However, this study used instant, explicit perceptions from the readers on a number of medical articles to test our hypothesized model regarding medical news articles and their effects on behavioral choice decisions.
SEMI	POS	PMC5266069.xml	S141	Discussion	POS	The results demonstrated that our model was able to explain the cognitive decision-making process of the readers, and also the saturated model.
SEMI	POS	PMC5266069.xml	S142	Discussion	POS	Additionally, we showed that interest, informativeness, and reliability of the article were important factors that should be considered in evaluating the quality of medical news articles and their possible effects on lay people.
SEMI	NEG	PMC5266070.xml	S50	Methods	NEG	Anesthesia was maintained by administering desflurane following endotracheal intubation.
SEMI	NEG	PMC5266070.xml	S105	Results	NEG	Eleven additional patients were excluded from the analysis after assignment, resulting in 51 patients in the non-TPCS group and 16 patients in the TPCS group (Fig. 2).
SEMI	NEG	PMC5266070.xml	S122	Discussion	NEG	The results of this study showed that prolonging the anhepatic phase by TPCS did not influence anesthetic sensitivity, as indicated by the anesthetic depth achieved using a constant dose of anesthetic and postoperative cognitive function.
SEMI	NEG	PMC5266070.xml	S134	Discussion	NEG	For this reason, the end-tidal desflurane concentration was fixed at 0.6 age-adjusted MAC, and its corresponding BIS values, which represented anesthetic sensitivity, were obtained in the present study.

SEMI	NEG	PMC5266150.xml	S161	Discussion	NEG	A Saudi genotype study of contemporary hemophilia A may help define the relationship between inhibitor development and genotype, as disruptive mutations (e.g., intron 22 inversions, large gene deletions, and stop codons) are associated with inhibitor formation in approximately 35% of patients with severe hemophilia A.
SEMI	NEG	PMC5266151.xml	S14	Abstract	NEG	The amount of irrigating fluid absorbed was significantly associated with the weight of resected prostatic tissue (P = 0.001) and change of INTEM-CT (P < 0.001).

SEMI	NEG	PMC5266168.xml	S88	Result	NEG	AP was 0.713 (95% CI, 0.255–0.912), suggesting that 71.3% CRC exposed to the 2 risk factors was caused by the additive interaction of NAFLD and MetS.
SEMI	POS	PMC5266168.xml	S125	Discussion	POS	The present study also had several limitations.
SEMI	POS	PMC5266168.xml	S126	Discussion	POS	First, the cross-sectional study design may not provide evidence to explain the potential mechanism of the combined interaction of NAFLD and MetS on the presence of CRC.
SEMI	POS	PMC5266168.xml	S127	Discussion	POS	Second, it is a retrospective study, so there may have been a selection bias.
SEMI	POS	PMC5266168.xml	S128	Discussion	POS	Third, NAFLD in our study is based on ultrasound imaging examination that is the most prevalent method of diagnosing NAFLD in clinical practice.
SEMI	POS	PMC5266168.xml	S129	Discussion	POS	Then, the number of CRC patients is relatively small and the study is a single-center research, so the result needs to be further investigated in a multiple-center research with a large size of participants.
SEMI	POS	PMC5266168.xml	S130	Discussion	POS	Finally, this study does not evaluate the potential interactive effect of NAFLD and MetS on the prognosis of CRC.

SEMI	NEG	PMC5266169.xml	S17	Abstract	NEG	After immobilization with a long-arm cast for 4 weeks, the cast was removed and range-of-motion exercises were encouraged.
SEMI	NEG	PMC5266169.xml	S37	Case presentation	NEG	The fracture was not reduced and was remarkably unstable (Fig. 1).
SEMI	NEG	PMC5266169.xml	S60	Discussion	NEG	Because humeral distal diaphyseal fractures are extremely unstable, it is difficult to reduce them while maintaining anatomical alignment.
SEMI	NEG	PMC5266170.xml	S27	Introduction	NEG	Pediatric pneumoperitoneum is an important clinical symptom in pediatric abdominal emergencies and more than 90% of occurrences are caused by perforation of the gastrointestinal tract and other hollow viscera.

SEMI	NEG	PMC5266171.xml	S81	Results	NEG	The O/E ratio was significantly lower in the specialized hospital group (0.9106) than in the non-specialized hospital group (1.0705, Fig. 3) (odds ratio [OR]: 0.784, 95% confidence interval [CI]: 0.672–0.914, P = 0.002).
SEMI	POS	PMC5266171.xml	S124	Discussion	POS	The current study has several limitations.
SEMI	POS	PMC5266171.xml	S125	Discussion	POS	First, as the category of “colorectal perforation” does not exist in the NCD, other categories (e.g., gastrointestinal perforation and cholecystitis) were used instead to collect relevant data.
SEMI	POS	PMC5266171.xml	S126	Discussion	POS	Additionally, there were no subcategories under ADP operation, which made it difficult to distinguish and isolate all the colorectal perforation-related cases for the study.
SEMI	POS	PMC5266171.xml	S127	Discussion	POS	An update to the NCD with more detailed subcategories is required for future studies.
SEMI	NEG	PMC5266171.xml	S131	Conclusions	NEG	The O/E ratio was significantly lower in the specialized hospital group (0.9106) than in the non-specialized hospital group (1.0704), specifically 15.98% lower.
SEMI	NEG	PMC5266172.xml	S3	Abstract	NEG	The purpose of this study was to develop and validate a finite element (FE) model to predict vertebral bone strength in vitro using multidetector computed tomography (MDCT) images in multiple myeloma (MM) patients, to serve as a complementing tool to assess fracture risk.
SEMI	NEG	PMC5266172.xml	S6	Abstract	NEG	Predicted fracture load using FE models correlated significantly with experimentally measured failure load (r = 0.85, P < 0.001).
SEMI	NEG	PMC5266172.xml	S11	Abstract	NEG	Such an FE visualization may have therapeutic consequences to prevent MM associated vertebral fractures.
SEMI	NEG	PMC5266172.xml	S20	Introduction	NEG	VCFs are known to occur at the onset of MM in 34% to 64% of patients.[5]

SEMI	NEG	PMC5266172.xml	S61	Materials and methods	NEG	The interpolated voxel size was of 146 × 146 × 300 μm3, while the real spatial resolution, as determined at q50 of the modulation-transfer-function, was 250 × 250 × 600 μm3.
SEMI	NEG	PMC5266172.xml	S85	Materials and methods	NEG	Material yield and ultimate failure were assumed to coincide, and a nonlinear postyield material behavior was adopted.[30]
SEMI	NEG	PMC5266172.xml	S89	Materials and methods	NEG	The predicted fracture load was defined as the peak force of the force–displacement curve over the displacement increments.
SEMI	NEG	PMC5266172.xml	S104	Materials and methods	NEG	All analyses were performed with a spreadsheet application (Microsoft Office Excel 2010, Redmond, WA).

SEMI	POS	PMC5266172.xml	S175	Discussion	POS	First, this preliminary study only examined 4 MM subjects, 2 with and 2 without fractures.
SEMI	POS	PMC5266172.xml	S176	Discussion	POS	Not only will a bigger sample enable statistical emphasis on the findings, a threshold value for the relative change between vertebra segments could be evaluated too.
SEMI	POS	PMC5266172.xml	S177	Discussion	POS	This threshold value will serve as a better clinical indication on the risk of fracture and consequently aid in predicting the occurrence of fractures.
SEMI	POS	PMC5266172.xml	S178	Discussion	POS	Also, the resolution of scans used for in vitro validation was higher than that of the scans used for in vivo scans of MM subjects, due to the restrictions imposed on radiation exposure.
SEMI	POS	PMC5266172.xml	S179	Discussion	POS	Thirdly, we analyzed one simple compressive loading condition, but there is a combination of loadings occurring in vivo, for example flexion, rotation, and bending.
SEMI	POS	PMC5266172.xml	S180	Discussion	POS	However, axial compressive loading accounts for 90% of fracture cases experienced by clinicians.
SEMI	POS	PMC5266172.xml	S181	Discussion	POS	Nevertheless, future work will entail using combination loading conditions to more accurately predict fractures in MM patients.
SEMI	POS	PMC5266172.xml	S182	Discussion	POS	Only fracture load values were used as an assessment parameter.
SEMI	POS	PMC5266172.xml	S183	Discussion	POS	Future study will also look into using geometric parameters such as buckling ratio, which has been proven to indicate structural stability.
SEMI	NEG	PMC5266173.xml	S24	Introduction	NEG	However, the use of CR or CT especially for neonates is limited because of transportation and inevitable radiation.
SEMI	NEG	PMC5266173.xml	S75	Results	NEG	A-line disappearance, interstitial syndrome, and lung consolidation could be found on LUS in all cases of neonatal pneumonia.
SEMI	NEG	PMC5266173.xml	S76	Results	NEG	As the pneumonia improved, LUS showed the scope of lung consolidation decreasing, the extent of interstitial syndrome alleviating, the pleural line gradually returning to normal, and the A-lines slowly appearing (Table 4, Fig. 3).
SEMI	NEG	PMC5266173.xml	S142	Discussion	NEG	However, in severe RDS (grade III or IV RDS on CR), the scope of lung consolidation extended deeper, and more air bronchograms were found on LUS.
SEMI	NEG	PMC5266174.xml	S23	Introduction	NEG	However, conventional PCMs barely overcome the resistance during epidural PCA, which requires drug delivery to the relatively resistant epidural space through a long, narrow catheter.
SEMI	NEG	PMC5266174.xml	S86	Results	NEG	Differences between the predicted and actual volume infused through the PCA pump were similar between the groups.
SEMI	NEG	PMC5266174.xml	S95	Discussion	NEG	This noninferiority comparison demonstrated that the elastomeric PCM was as effective as conventional PCM, with similar safety profiles, in providing epidural analgesia after upper abdominal surgery.
SEMI	NEG	PMC5266174.xml	S130	Discussion	NEG	Third, pain control tended to be superior in the elastomeric group, although VNRS for pain at only 1 time point (18–24 hours postoperatively) showed statistical significance.
SEMI	NEG	PMC5266175.xml	S72	Results	NEG	Our research shows that only 17 (9.2%) men suffered from galactorrhea, and 16 (8.7%) men presented with gynecomastia.

SEMI	NEG	PMC5266175.xml	S149	Discussion	NEG	Although the main manifestations for female patients include oligomenorrhea and galactorrhea, most male patients complain of osteoporosis and libido reduction in the form of impotence, oligospermia, and erectile dysfunction.
SEMI	NEG	PMC5266175.xml	S160	Discussion	NEG	Indications for neurosurgery include resistance to bromocriptine or cabergoline treatment, intolerability of side effects, leakage of CSF due to the shrinking tumor, rapid diminution of vision, cranial nerve palsy caused by tumor bleeding and pituitary apoplexy, and a strong patient preference.[1–3]
SEMI	NEG	PMC5266176.xml	S10	Abstract	NEG	By further analysis, we revealed lower corneal horizontal curvature and much higher corneal Q-value differences between the nasal–temporal and superior–inferior quadrants in the lens-decentration group compared to the control group (P < 0.05).
SEMI	NEG	PMC5266176.xml	S26	Introduction	NEG	Thus, it is possible that complex corneal morphology and the lack of individualized lens underlie the occurrence of lens decentration.[2,11]
SEMI	NEG	PMC5266176.xml	S77	Results	NEG	Baseline characteristics were compared between the 2 groups including age and the degree and duration of myopia (Table 1).
SEMI	NEG	PMC5266176.xml	S105	Discussion	NEG	But Chen et al recently reported variations in the Q-values for different regions of the anterior corneal surface, indicating that a single value could not precisely reflect corneal Q-value.[9,17]
SEMI	NEG	PMC5266177.xml	S23		NEG	However, there are unmet clinical needs since applicable regiments with sustained effects are rare.
SEMI	NEG	PMC5266177.xml	S83		NEG	Among them, 46 patients did not practice MBE (mean age, 56.1 ± 10.0 years).

SEMI	NEG	PMC5266178.xml	S53	Materials and methods	NEG	This was followed by dynamic high-resolution simultaneous imaging of both breasts using the THRIVE sequence with 8 dynamic scans with fat saturation, performed after intravenous administration of a contrast agent (gadopentetate dimeglumine, 0.1 mmol/kg).
SEMI	NEG	PMC5266178.xml	S54	Materials and methods	NEG	Postprocessing consisted of 2 series of subtraction images.
SEMI	NEG	PMC5266178.xml	S123	Discussion	NEG	Because of a lack of pathologic validation, diagnosing breast cancer lesions by MRI alone could produce false-positive or false-negative results.[28,29]
SEMI	NEG	PMC5266178.xml	S128	Discussion	NEG	While there was no statistically significant difference between GTVMRI+1 and GTVES, they were not correlated with each other either.
SEMI	NEG	PMC5266179.xml	S44		NEG	The cumulative AFP normalization and HCC development rates were measured from the date of enrollment (date of an AFP measurement >100 ng/mL) until the date of death, last follow-up, or study end date (January 31, 2016).
SEMI	NEG	PMC5266179.xml	S58		NEG	All analyses were 2-sided, and a P value <0.05 was considered statistically significant.
SEMI	NEG	PMC5266179.xml	S66		NEG	The Child-Pugh score and AST, ALT, and bilirubin levels were significantly higher in patients with CHB than in patients with CHC.
SEMI	NEG	PMC5266179.xml	S88		NEG	Among the 21 patients with CHB who did not receive antiviral therapy, the probability of AFP normalization in patients who did not develop HCC was higher than in patients who did develop HCC (P = 0.008, Supplementary Fig. 3B).

SEMI	NEG	PMC5266180.xml	S21		NEG	This is particularly the case for the human immunodeficiency virus (HIV)-infected population, with 1 review placing the mean prevalence of syphilis in the HIV-infected population at 9.5%.[3]
SEMI	NEG	PMC5266180.xml	S22		NEG	The importance of syphilis as a coinfection in HIV-infected individuals does not only stem from the negative effect of syphilis on the natural course of HIV infection (manifested as a temporary reduction in CD4 cells and an elevation in HIV viral load[4,5]) but also from the enhancement of HIV transmission in individuals coinfected with syphilis.[6]
SEMI	NEG	PMC5266180.xml	S23		NEG	It is estimated that 60% of syphilis cases are asymptomatic,[2] and syphilis infection enhances HIV transmission and other coinfections (e.g., Hepatitis B[7] and Hepatitis C[8]), which places syphilis coinfection in the forefront of HIV transmission and public health concerns.
SEMI	NEG	PMC5266183.xml	S19	Introduction	NEG	Hyperuricemia is the central risk factor for gout and the pharmacologic therapeutic goal of gout is to lower serum uric acid level below 6 mg/dL, the saturation point for monosodium urate.[1,2]

SEMI	NEG	PMC5266185.xml	S69	Materials and methods	NEG	Because the pelvic and right subdiaphragmatic regions of the parietal peritoneum are susceptible areas for peritoneal implantation (SAPI),whereas the remaining regions are less-susceptible areas for peritoneal implantation (LSAPI),[26–28] the distribution of the parietal peritoneum lesions was classified as the SAPI distribution, in which the lesions were completely or primarily localized in the pelvic and/or right subdiaphragmatic region; the LSAPI distribution, in which the lesions were completely or primarily localized in the remaining regions; or the uniform distribution, in which the lesions were uniformly distributed in the susceptible and less-susceptible areas.
SEMI	NEG	PMC5266185.xml	S70	Materials and methods	NEG	According to the continuity observed among the 18F-FDG-avid lesions in the sectional PET images, the morphological patterns included the following: (1) lesions continuously disseminated beyond a single region showing18F-FDG uptake in a long beaded line (string-of-beads 18F-FDG uptake) (Figs. 1A and C); (2) lesions continuously disseminated in a single region showing clustered 18F-FDG uptake (Figs. 2A and C); or (3) lesion(s) discontinuously disseminated showing isolated or discrete 18F-FDG uptake (focal 18F-FDG uptake) (Figs. 3A and C).

SEMI	NEG	PMC5268054.xml	S51	Materials and methods	NEG	The macroscopic lesion types were classified with data collected from the endoscopic reports according to the early gastric cancer classification method that was proposed by the Japan Gastroenterological Endoscopy Society in 1962.[8] This method classifies gastric cancers into 3 types: elevated type (protruding and superficially elevated lesions), flat type (superficially flat lesions), and depressed type (superficially depressed and excavated lesions).
SEMI	NEG	PMC5268054.xml	S55	Materials and methods	NEG	Pyloric ring stenosis was defined as when an endoscope (GIF-Q240J or GIF-Q260J; Olympus) could not pass through the pyloric ring, which prevented entry into the duodenum.
SEMI	NEG	PMC5268054.xml	S99	Results	NEG	The number of procedures ranged from 1 in 2 patients to 8 in 1 patient who experienced recurrent symptoms.
SEMI	NEG	PMC5268054.xml	S123	Discussion	NEG	In this study, ratio of the resected region to the pyloric ring circumference ≥75% was found to be statistically significant risk factor.

SEMI	POS	PMC5268054.xml	S143	Discussion	POS	The present study has several limitations.
SEMI	POS	PMC5268054.xml	S144	Discussion	POS	First, since the study was a retrospective study based on clinical records and endoscopic images, cases could have been omitted, or bias could have been present during the review of results.
SEMI	POS	PMC5268054.xml	S145	Discussion	POS	Second, the procedure was conducted at a single center and by 1 endoscopic expert for most cases and therefore, it is difficult to generalize the results.
SEMI	POS	PMC5268054.xml	S146	Discussion	POS	Third, magnifying endoscopy with narrow-band imaging (NBI) is a promising endoscopic technique that may improve the accuracy of diagnosis of gastric lesions.[22]
SEMI	POS	PMC5268054.xml	S147	Discussion	POS	Unfortunately, we could not use magnifying endoscopy with NBI to evaluate the gastric lesions due to a limitation of our hospital equipment.
SEMI	POS	PMC5268054.xml	S148	Discussion	POS	Lastly, as only 9 patients had pyloric stenosis, the result interpretation is limited.
SEMI	POS	PMC5268054.xml	S149	Discussion	POS	Moreover, in the statistical analysis, chi-squared test was conducted through Fisher exact test due to low expected frequencies.

SEMI	NEG	PMC5268055.xml	S40	Introduction	NEG	The influences of sex, age, and body mass index (BMI) on lipid metabolism were also taken into account in this study to determine the association of ApoE polymorphism and lipid profiles, which may be partly attributed to genetic variations in ApoE.
SEMI	NEG	PMC5268055.xml	S96	Results	NEG	These results indicate that age influences serum TC, TG, and LDL-C levels in a gene-dependent manner.
SEMI	NEG	PMC5268055.xml	S106	Discussion	NEG	An important part of our study was determining the influence of ApoE genotypes and alleles on serum lipid concentrations in a Shandong Han population.
SEMI	NEG	PMC5268057.xml	S45	Methods	NEG	A vertical deviation is graded on a scale of −4 (underaction) to +4 (overaction), with 0 being normal.

SEMI	NEG	PMC5268059.xml	S9	Abstract	NEG	In order to identify the effect of vagus nerve severance, patients who received gastrectomy or antrectomy were also excluded.
SEMI	NEG	PMC5268059.xml	S59	Method	NEG	Based on the management of ulcers and complicated peptic ulcers, we grouped the patients into 4 subgroups by the management received: 1.
SEMI	NEG	PMC5268059.xml	S69	Method	NEG	Surgical treatments for complicated peptic ulcers included TVP (ICD-9 operation code 44.01 and 44.2), SSH (ICD-9 operation code 44.4), gastrectomy (ICD-9 operation code 43.5–43.9), and HSV (ICD-9 operation code and 44.02) in our study.
SEMI	NEG	PMC5268059.xml	S76	Method	NEG	The incidence of IHD (per 1000 person-years) was calculated in both cohorts.
SEMI	NEG	PMC5268059.xml	S79	Method	NEG	The interaction test between sex and ulcer, age and ulcer, CCI score and ulcer, hyperlipidemia, and hypertension and ulcer were assessed using crude Cox proportional hazard regression.
SEMI	NEG	PMC5268059.xml	S85	Result	NEG	In the peptic ulcer patients cohort, there were more men than women (62.4% vs 37.6%), and the mean age was 56.4 y/o (standard deviation = 17.5) (Table 1).
SEMI	NEG	PMC5268059.xml	S86	Result	NEG	There were 13.5% ulcer patients with higher CCI score (≥2), 24.3% with hypertension, and 6.09% with hyperlipidemia.
SEMI	NEG	PMC5268059.xml	S93	Result	NEG	When stratified with hypertension, the risk of IHD in patients without hypertension was higher than those with hypertension (HR = 1.53 vs 1.39, 95% CI = 1.49–1.56 vs 1.35–1.42, Table 2).
SEMI	NEG	PMC5268059.xml	S94	Result	NEG	No matter patients were with or without hyperlipidemia, there was similar higher IHD effect in peptic ulcer patients compared with comparisons.
SEMI	POS	PMC5268059.xml	S146	Discussion	POS	This study has the strengths of including a large study population, longitudinal design, reliable diagnosis, and high follow-up rate.
SEMI	POS	PMC5268059.xml	S147	Discussion	POS	However, certain limitations also exist.
SEMI	POS	PMC5268059.xml	S148	Discussion	POS	First, several risk factors such as complete lifestyle information with respect to drinking, smoking, blood cholesterol levels, obesity, metabolic syndrome, physical activity, diet style, socioeconomic status, and genetic factors were not available for IHD risk adjustment.
SEMI	POS	PMC5268059.xml	S149	Discussion	POS	To reduce this bias, we tried to control for diseases derived from bad lifestyle, such as: smoking-associated diseases; including chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, stroke, and lung cancer; alcohol-associated diseases, including alcoholic cirrhosis, and chronic hepatitis; metabolic syndrome-associated diseases, including hyperlipidemia, and diabetes.
SEMI	POS	PMC5268059.xml	S150	Discussion	POS	We chose CCI comorbidity score because the diseases mentioned above are considered in the CCI score.
SEMI	POS	PMC5268059.xml	S151	Discussion	POS	Second, in spite of the meticulous design of our study to control for confounding factors, bias resulting from the retrospective nature of the study could have influenced our results.
SEMI	POS	PMC5268059.xml	S152	Discussion	POS	Third, there was a lack of information on the status of hyperacidity, which is a potential risk factor of peptic ulcer.
SEMI	POS	PMC5268059.xml	S153	Discussion	POS	Therefore, we might have overestimated the incidence of IHD in all study subjects.
SEMI	POS	PMC5268059.xml	S154	Discussion	POS	However, the results still showed a higher risk of IHD in peptic ulcer patients than normal controls.
SEMI	POS	PMC5268059.xml	S155	Discussion	POS	Fourth, all data used were anonymous.
SEMI	POS	PMC5268059.xml	S156	Discussion	POS	Therefore, relevant clinical variables, such as pathology findings, imaging results, and serum laboratory data were unavailable in our study.
SEMI	POS	PMC5268059.xml	S157	Discussion	POS	Nonetheless, the data regarding IHD, TVP, highly selective vagotomy, simple closure surgery, and the diagnosis of peptic ulcers were highly reliable.

SEMI	NEG	PMC5268060.xml	S11	Abstract	NEG	There was no significant association between obesity and pterygium in men.
SEMI	NEG	PMC5268060.xml	S66	Methods	NEG	Subjects were categorized into 3 groups according to the average alcohol amount (g) of consumed per day for a month before the interview: nondrinkers, light to moderate drinkers (1–30 g/day), and heavy drinkers (>30 g/day).[28]
SEMI	NEG	PMC5268060.xml	S112	Results	NEG	After a further adjustment for smoking status, alcohol consumption, and physical activity (Model 2), overweight women had an OR (95% CI) of 1.11 (0.83–1.49) and obese women had an OR (95% CI) of 1.34 (1.03–1.76) compared to women with normal weight (P for trend for ORs = 0.03).
SEMI	NEG	PMC5268060.xml	S140	Discussion	NEG	Sex differences in occupational and sunlight exposure do not explain the persistent 4-fold increased risk of pterygium in men.
SEMI	NEG	PMC5268061.xml	S38	Case report	NEG	Transthoracic 2-dimensional echocardiography revealed poor left ventricular performance and global hypokinesis with LVEF of 23%.
SEMI	NEG	PMC5268061.xml	S58	Case report	NEG	We removed IABP and ECMO until cardiac contractile function improved to left ventricular ejection fraction over 40 percentage after 1 week.
SEMI	NEG	PMC5268061.xml	S70	Discussion	NEG	The choice of the most appropriate revascularization strategy is still controversial in diabetes patients.
SEMI	NEG	PMC5268061.xml	S93	Discussion	NEG	In addition, the combination of 3 techniques (balloon anchoring technique, 5-in-6 technique, and deep-seating technique) was important for stent deployment of extremely angulated vessel.
SEMI	NEG	PMC5268062.xml	S59	Patients and methods	NEG	The RVFAC was computed as reported (ref): (RV diastolic area–RV systolic area)/RV diastolic area × 100%.
SEMI	NEG	PMC5268062.xml	S61	Patients and methods	NEG	RVFAC = the right ventricular index of myocardial performance (RIMP) was the isovolumic time divided by the ejecting time, which was evaluated in the same pulsed.
SEMI	NEG	PMC5268062.xml	S71	Patients and methods	NEG	The right ventricle was partitioned into 6 standard segments at 3 levels (i.e., the basal, middle, and apical levels), correspondingly generating 6 time-strain curves (Fig. 1).
SEMI	NEG	PMC5268062.xml	S104	Results	NEG	Both groups were comparable in terms of left ventricular transverse diameter (LVTD), inner diameter of main pulmonary artery (DMPA), inner diameter of left arterial branch (DLPA), and inner diameter of right pulmonary arterial branch (DRPA).
SEMI	NEG	PMC5268062.xml	S107	Results	NEG	Patients with RV LPSS ≥−19% exhibited lower RV function (Table 2).
SEMI	NEG	PMC5268062.xml	S137	Discussion	NEG	In the current study, no significant differences in age, tricuspid regurgitation area, SPAP, or left ventricular ejection fraction (LVEF) between the 2 groups were observed.
SEMI	NEG	PMC5268062.xml	S144	Discussion	NEG	Patients with RV LPSS ≥−19% had a worse RV function.
SEMI	NEG	PMC5268062.xml	S146	Discussion	NEG	It is well known that myocardial strain describes the extent of myocardial deformation.
SEMI	NEG	PMC5268062.xml	S163	Discussion	NEG	In a previous study, RV LPSS was used to detect RV dysfunction in patients with severe PH, as well as early RV dysfunction in patients with mild PH.[27]
SEMI	POS	PMC5268062.xml	S172	Study limitations	POS	Several limitations present in our study need to be pointed out.
SEMI	POS	PMC5268062.xml	S173	Study limitations	POS	First, echocardiographic studies and RHC were not performed simultaneously.
SEMI	POS	PMC5268062.xml	S174	Study limitations	POS	Second, we did not include control subjects with an mPAP <25 mm Hg.
SEMI	POS	PMC5268062.xml	S175	Study limitations	POS	Third, because RHC is an invasive examination, its clinical application has indications, and not all patients could undergo the examination.
SEMI	POS	PMC5268062.xml	S176	Study limitations	POS	Fourth, PVR is an important index of pulmonary hemodynamics as reflected in the pulmonary circulation pressure flow relationship.
SEMI	POS	PMC5268062.xml	S177	Study limitations	POS	Therefore, the elevation of PVR is also considered a generalized pulmonary arterial hypertension.
SEMI	POS	PMC5268062.xml	S178	Study limitations	POS	However, our study included several types of PH and demonstrated the issue of heterogeneity to some degree.
SEMI	POS	PMC5268062.xml	S179	Study limitations	POS	Thus, elevated PVR was not considered in our study.

SEMI	POS	PMC5268063.xml	S134	Discussion	POS	This study suffers from some limitations.
SEMI	POS	PMC5268063.xml	S135	Discussion	POS	The cross-sectional design of study prohibits temporal assessment between obesity and severity of atherosclerosis.
SEMI	POS	PMC5268063.xml	S136	Discussion	POS	In our study, we could not assess nonalcoholic fatty liver disease as a consequence of the metabolic syndrome, in which abdominal adiposity plays a key role.
SEMI	POS	PMC5268063.xml	S137	Discussion	POS	In addition, there may be residual confounding from unmeasured confounders such as economic status.
SEMI	NEG	PMC5268065.xml	S27		NEG	Thus, there have been recent efforts to improve the detection and diagnosis of COPD.
SEMI	NEG	PMC5268065.xml	S37		NEG	Studies identifying the cut-off value for FEV1/FEV6 to diagnose airflow limitation have produced variable results, with values between 0.7 and 0.8.[16,17] Therefore, the purpose of this study was to determine the applicability of handheld spirometry as an active case-finding tool for the patients with risk factors for development of COPD in a primary clinical setting.
SEMI	NEG	PMC5268065.xml	S62		NEG	We attempted to obtain more than 90% specificity using handheld spirometry and a desired confidence level of 0.05, and determined that at least 161 patients were required for this study.

SEMI	NEG	PMC5268065.xml	S73		NEG	This study was approved by the board of each participating institution.
SEMI	NEG	PMC5268065.xml	S140		NEG	We evaluated the correlation between FEV1/FEV6 determined by handheld spirometry at primary clinics and FEV1/FVC determined by conventional spirometry.
SEMI	NEG	PMC5268065.xml	S154		NEG	In previous studies, subjects classified as false negatives had either mild or moderate COPD, rather than severe or very severe COPD in screening using handheld spirometry devices.[28,29]
SEMI	NEG	PMC5268065.xml	S156		NEG	In a practical setting, if individuals with risk factors for COPD were misjudged as normal determined by handheld spirometry, they would expected to have a lower probability of COPD or if this were not identified, they would mild COPD.
SEMI	POS	PMC5268065.xml	S162		POS	This study had some limitations.
SEMI	POS	PMC5268065.xml	S163		POS	We recruited the participants in summer, so a concern might arise that we could not recruit participants appropriate for the purpose of the study.
SEMI	POS	PMC5268065.xml	S164		POS	Nevertheless, although COPD symptoms may be aggravated by cold weather, the airflow limitation required to diagnose COPD is persistent.[1]
SEMI	POS	PMC5268065.xml	S165		POS	Not only that, the participants were asked again to make sure about their symptoms using “Could it be COPD” questionnaire released by GOLD, which does not include the questions about the symptoms affected by the weather.

SEMI	POS	PMC5268065.xml	S168		POS	We only used the data of the participants who were referred to the tertiary referral hospitals, which might cause some skewness in the collected data.
SEMI	POS	PMC5268065.xml	S169		POS	To overcome these limitations, a larger study to validate our suggested strategy with carefully handing the excluded subjects is needed.
SEMI	NEG	PMC5268066.xml	S33	Introduction	NEG	Similarly, Choi et al[25] reported impaired inhibitory control as a core neurocognitive factor in patients with IGD.
SEMI	NEG	PMC5268066.xml	S43	Introduction	NEG	Based on previous reviews of IGD and related addiction treatment studies,[22,31] we hypothesized that patients with IGD would show improved executive functioning, particularly inhibitory control ability, and that they would report increased subjective QOL and psychological well-being after 6 months of outpatient management.
SEMI	NEG	PMC5268066.xml	S51	Methods	NEG	We only included patients with IAT scores ≥70 who spent more than 4 h/d and 30 h/wk using Internet games, with the aim of studying only those with severe IGD rather than those at high risk for developing the disorder due to excessive Internet gaming.
SEMI	NEG	PMC5268066.xml	S120	Methods	NEG	The clinical and cognitive data were analyzed separately to minimize extraneous effects of the covariate.
SEMI	NEG	PMC5268066.xml	S122	Methods	NEG	Third, stepwise multiple regression was performed to examine the associations between baseline clinical/cognitive data and changes in the IAT score (IAT score at pre-treatment minus IAT score at post-treatment), which allowed us to predict treatment prognosis for patients with IGD.
SEMI	NEG	PMC5268066.xml	S133	Results	NEG	The IGD group exhibited higher IAT (P < 0.001), BAI (P = 0.005), BDI (P < 0.001), PWI (P < 0.001), BIS-11 (P < 0.001), STAXI_trait anger (P = 0.02), and AQ (P = 0.001) scores than those of the HC group.

SEMI	NEG	PMC5268066.xml	S141	Results	NEG	Significant increases were observed for the scores on the SST proportion of successful stops last sub-block (P = 0.001) and SSP span length (P = 0.031), indicating that patients’ response inhibition and working memory were enhanced following treatment.
SEMI	NEG	PMC5268066.xml	S168	Discussion	NEG	In addition, many SUD studies have suggested that working memory function is linked to inhibitory control, such that reduced working memory function may facilitate drug cravings.[31,80]

SEMI	POS	PMC5268066.xml	S181	Discussion	POS	The present study has several limitations.
SEMI	POS	PMC5268066.xml	S182	Discussion	POS	First, sample size was small; therefore, the results may not be representative of all patients with IGD.
SEMI	POS	PMC5268066.xml	S183	Discussion	POS	In addition, only male participants were included in this study.
SEMI	POS	PMC5268066.xml	S184	Discussion	POS	Further study with a larger number of participants, including females, is needed to allow for broader generalization of the results.
SEMI	POS	PMC5268066.xml	S185	Discussion	POS	Second, the treatment modules were not well organized, consisting of the usual outpatient care, making it difficult to draw specific inferences about the effects of treatment.
SEMI	POS	PMC5268066.xml	S186	Discussion	POS	However, the main focus of this study was assessing subjective QOL and identifying neurocognitive markers associated with longitudinal symptom changes in IGD rather than on evaluating the effects of the treatment itself.
SEMI	POS	PMC5268066.xml	S187	Discussion	POS	In the future, it will be necessary to investigate the effects of specific treatment modules on QOL and neurocognitive markers in patients with IGD.
SEMI	POS	PMC5268066.xml	S188	Discussion	POS	Third, participants with IGD in the present study had comorbid depressive or anxiety symptoms, and these comorbidities may have influenced the effects of treatment.
SEMI	POS	PMC5268066.xml	S189	Discussion	POS	However, the patients showed no significant changes in the BDI or BAI scores after treatment, suggesting that improvements in addiction symptoms through treatment may be associated with increased psychological well-being, regardless of comorbid mood states.
SEMI	POS	PMC5268066.xml	S190	Discussion	POS	Also, most patients with IGD in clinical settings have various comorbidities; thus, the present findings may provide important clinical information regarding the underlying pathophysiology associated with IGD.
SEMI	POS	PMC5268066.xml	S191	Discussion	POS	Finally, high dropout rate of IGD group might lead to incomplete information and possibly flawed conclusions.
SEMI	POS	PMC5268066.xml	S192	Discussion	POS	But, it is well known that IGD correlated with impulsivity.[23]
SEMI	POS	PMC5268066.xml	S193	Discussion	POS	The high dropout rate may be a feature of IGD, and, further, dropout subjects had less severe mental health problems than completed patients, indicating that completed patients were more likely to have motivations to the treatment.

SEMI	NEG	PMC5269572.xml	S56	Introduction	NEG	Although a small overlap exists between HubBLe and eTHoS, the trials were designed to dovetail together with less advanced disease falling mainly into the HubBLe trial and more advanced disease eligible for eTHoS.
SEMI	NEG	PMC5269572.xml	S136	Methods	NEG	The secondary outcome tenesmus was analysed with the χ2 test for trend, further surgical intervention was analysed with the χ2 test.
SEMI	NEG	PMC5269572.xml	S170	Results	NEG	Subgroup analyses of sex and grade of haemorrhoid did not reveal treatment effect differences in EQ-5D-3L AUC (appendix p 1).
SEMI	NEG	PMC5269572.xml	S180	Results	NEG	Participant reported pain with VAS was significantly better in the stapled haemorrhoidopexy group at 1 and 3 weeks after surgery than in the traditional excisional surgery group but no difference between groups was noted at 6 weeks (appendix p 2).
SEMI	NEG	PMC5269572.xml	S186	Results	NEG	24 (7%) participants had a serious adverse event after undergoing stapled haemorrhoidopexy and 33 (9%) after receiving traditional excisional surgery (table 4).
SEMI	NEG	PMC5269572.xml	S191	Results	NEG	Ten participants remained in hospital or were readmitted with pain in the traditional excisional surgery group compared with six in the stapled haemorrhoidopexy group.

SEMI	POS	PMC5269572.xml	S246	Discussion	POS	The trial had several limitations.
SEMI	POS	PMC5269572.xml	S247	Discussion	POS	As noted previously, participants and outcome assessors were not masked to treatment assignment which could have led to bias when measuring the subjective outcomes.
SEMI	POS	PMC5269572.xml	S248	Discussion	POS	Final recruitment to eTHoS was slightly short of the total target of 800 participants and, furthermore, there were substantial, and greater than anticipated, missing data at 24 months follow-up despite multiple strategies to mitigate this.
SEMI	POS	PMC5269572.xml	S249	Discussion	POS	This, perhaps, reflected the population (working age), the condition (chronic and considered by some to be a sensitive subject), and the nature of the follow-up.
SEMI	POS	PMC5269572.xml	S250	Discussion	POS	Nevertheless, the study still had sufficient statistical precision to detect differences between treatment groups.
SEMI	POS	PMC5269572.xml	S251	Discussion	POS	Various secondary analyses explored plausible imputation and missing data assumptions regarding quality of life and a consistent pattern of benefit in favour of traditional excisional surgery was reported.
SEMI	POS	PMC5269572.xml	S252	Discussion	POS	A noticeable amount of non-compliance with allocation (some not receiving surgery, and some receiving a different operation) was noted reflecting perhaps a mixture of clinical reality and also some surgeon and patient preferences regarding treatment.
SEMI	POS	PMC5269572.xml	S253	Discussion	POS	Such non-compliance tends to dilute a genuine effect.
SEMI	POS	PMC5269572.xml	S254	Discussion	POS	We assessed the effect of non-compliance in the per-protocol population (appendix p 1).
SEMI	POS	PMC5269572.xml	S255	Discussion	POS	Despite this, the primary analysis still supported a difference in favour of traditional excisional surgery, and the per-protocol analysis of only those who complied with allocation was consistent with this finding.
SEMI	POS	PMC5269572.xml	S256	Discussion	POS	The delivery of the interventions reflected routine clinical practice across a range of centres in terms of the surgeons participating (their experience) and how the interventions were delivered (specific technique, centre practices).
SEMI	POS	PMC5269572.xml	S257	Discussion	POS	Comparison of outcome between surgeons and surgical practice was difficult in this context because of the numerous factors which affect patients and centres which were not attributable to the surgeon.
SEMI	POS	PMC5269572.xml	S258	Discussion	POS	Taken together, we believe the findings are robust and generalisable.
SEMI	NEG	PMC5273858.xml	S32	Background	NEG	So far the effect of whole DE (a complex mixture of both particles and gaseous component) on host defense function of cultured primary human airway epithelial cells has not been studied.

SEMI	NEG	PMC5279074.xml	S167	Results	NEG	Comparing the CT-PI parameters, AFP concentration, and the ADC value of target lesions after the treatment in the patients with or without recurrence, we found that the parameters HBF, AFP, HBV, PS, HAP, and HPI were significantly high in the recurrent patients compared with the nonrecurrent ones, while MTT along with the ADC value significantly decreased (all P < 0.05) (Table 6).
SEMI	NEG	PMC5279074.xml	S176	Discussion	NEG	Besides, the ADC value on MR-DWI and parameters of CT-PI were the target of our study to assess their value in evaluating the efficacy and prognosis of TACE combined with CT-RFA for HCC.
SEMI	NEG	PMC5279076.xml	S120	Results	NEG	Nine (75%) patients reported subjective proximal skeletal muscle weakness on average within 12 months of diagnosis.

SEMI	NEG	PMC5279095.xml	S23		NEG	Quantifying the severity of displacement in DDH is important for its diagnosis and treatment.
SEMI	NEG	PMC5279095.xml	S86		NEG	The chi-square values of the relation of the 2 classifications with the treatment selection were 127.7552 and 102.3886, respectively (P < 0.01), which means that both classifications were relevant in detecting the DDH treatment type.
SEMI	NEG	PMC5279095.xml	S92		NEG	Therefore, the IHDI classification seems to be the upgraded version of the Tonnis classification.[15]
SEMI	NEG	PMC5279095.xml	S99		NEG	Both the IHDI and Tonnis classifications were associated with the treatment type, and the significance level of both was P < 0.001, which means that the 2 classifications can predict the operation type.[16]
SEMI	NEG	PMC5279095.xml	S101		NEG	It is possible that the proximal femoral ossific nucleus becomes clearer and easier to judge with increasing age; however, the H-point is always prone to identification.[17,18]

SEMI	POS	PMC5279095.xml	S110		POS	Third, we have not classified the pelvic radiographs at the endpoint of the follow-up which received the treatment.
SEMI	POS	PMC5279095.xml	S111		POS	Comparing to the Tonnis classification, the IHDI may also have some limitation such as requiring a more stringent radiographic position.
SEMI	POS	PMC5279095.xml	S112		POS	The H-point is located on the distal side of femoral proximal ossific nucleus, but the femoral proximal ossific nucleus near or located in the center of femoral head, which is similar to the relationship between a circle's center and boundary.
SEMI	POS	PMC5279095.xml	S113		POS	When the children thigh is in abduction or adduction position during examination, the displacement of H-point will be significantly greater than ossific nucleus which will leading to obvious misjudgment by the IHDI classification.

SEMI	POS	PMC5279096.xml	S119	Discussion	POS	First, this was before-and-after study conducted at a single center with historical controls, and therefore our results cannot be generalized to other institutions.
SEMI	POS	PMC5279096.xml	S120	Discussion	POS	Second, the statistical model might not have captured the ceiling effect or attenuation of the increasing preintervention trajectory; accordingly, the modeled net effect might be greater than would be clinically observed.
SEMI	POS	PMC5279096.xml	S121	Discussion	POS	In addition, the time period of only 1 year after the campaign might limit the significance and validity of the piecewise regression analysis and the long-term behavioral changes was not addressed in prescribing patterns for physicians ordering the radiographs.

SEMI	POS	PMC5279097.xml	S198	Discussion	POS	First, the correlation between the topography of PC and the occurrence of AP is not clearly interpreted because of the retrospective nature of the study.
SEMI	POS	PMC5279097.xml	S199	Discussion	POS	Second, we could not include all patients in the analysis, as some patients diagnosed with PC >2 years may present with CP.
SEMI	POS	PMC5279097.xml	S200	Discussion	POS	Due to missing data on some important variables, patients diagnosed as AP in other medical center were excluded from the study.
SEMI	POS	PMC5279097.xml	S201	Discussion	POS	Furthermore, the sample size was small, and the time of our follow-up period was short.

SEMI	NEG	PMC5279099.xml	S113	Discussion	NEG	It seemed that the intervendor differences of ADC measurements were inconsistent in the organ of upper abdomen, and the liver exhibited greater variation than others.
SEMI	NEG	PMC5279099.xml	S127	Discussion	NEG	Second, MR scanners of 1.5 and 3.0 T were from different vendors for assessing the effect of field strengths on ADC measurement.
SEMI	NEG	PMC5279099.xml	S130	Discussion	NEG	Theoretically, ADCs obtained by the intravoxel incoherent motion (IVIM) model with multiple b values could provide more precise information on tissue perfusion and diffusivity base.[34]

SEMI	NEG	PMC5284330.xml	S9	Background	NEG	In the long-term extension PATENT-2, patients received riociguat (maximum 2.5 mg three times daily); the primary endpoint was safety and tolerability.
SEMI	NEG	PMC5284330.xml	S52	Results	NEG	In the PAH-CTD population at week 12, riociguat 2.5 mg maximum increased mean±SD 6MWD by +18±51 m compared with a decrease of −8±110 m in the placebo group (see online supplementary figure S2A) (LS mean treatment difference: +28 m; 95% CI −4 to 61 m).

SEMI	NEG	PMC5284338.xml	S52	Patients and methods	NEG	This open-label, single-arm extension of PLANETRA was conducted in 69 centres in 16 countries.
SEMI	NEG	PMC5284338.xml	S141	Discussion	NEG	The PLANETRA extension study examined the efficacy and safety of treatment with a maximum of six infusions of CT-P13 in patients with RA previously treated with either CT-P13 (maintenance group) or infliximab RP (switch group) for 54 weeks.
SEMI	NEG	PMC5284338.xml	S142	Discussion	NEG	Importantly, in the switch group, no notable differences in ACR response rates were observed between week 54 (ie, the last RP treatment) and week 102 (ie, 48 weeks after the last RP infusion).
SEMI	NEG	PMC5284338.xml	S187	Discussion	NEG	The current extension study was not formally designed to evaluate the non-inferiority or equivalence of switching to CT-P13 from RP versus continual CT-P13 treatment.
SEMI	NEG	PMC5284339.xml	S15	Background	NEG	Relative risk of major birth defects and spontaneous abortions in adalimumab-exposed women were similar between that of unexposed women with RA and healthy women.

SEMI	POS	PMC5284339.xml	S113	Discussion	POS	Limiting this analysis to clinical trial experience may not fully reflect clinical practice, due to selection bias of trial populations, survival of completers and comorbidities.
SEMI	POS	PMC5284339.xml	S114	Discussion	POS	Comparisons with other treatments are limited due to the lack of a control group with any specific active treatment.
SEMI	NEG	PMC5284340.xml	S28	Introduction	NEG	CT-P13 has been approved by the European Medicines Agency (EMA) for all indications held by the infliximab RP.

SEMI	NEG	PMC5284347.xml	S4	Objectives	NEG	The aim of this study was to investigate the incidence of invasive cutaneous melanomas in patients with rheumatoid arthritis (RA) treated with TNF inhibitors (TNFi), other biologic disease modifying drugs and non-biologic therapy.
SEMI	NEG	PMC5284347.xml	S6	Objectives	NEG	Eleven biologic registers from nine European countries participated in this collaborative project.
SEMI	NEG	PMC5284347.xml	S51	Patients and methods	NEG	In registries where a drug cohort had fewer than 1000 person-years (pyrs) of follow-up accumulated this subcohort was excluded from the analysis, since these subcohorts very likely contribute only to the denominator (pyrs) but not to the numerator (number of events) of the incidence rates.
SEMI	NEG	PMC5284347.xml	S124	Discussion	NEG	Nonetheless, the findings of the different registers were rather consistent.
SEMI	NEG	PMC5284348.xml	S21	Introduction	NEG	On the effector side, T cells from the inflamed joints are resistant to Treg cell-mediated suppression thanks to protein kinase B (PKB) hyperactivation in JIA.9 10
SEMI	NEG	PMC5284348.xml	S29	Introduction	NEG	In this regard, recent data demonstrate that Treg cells are a heterogeneous population.
SEMI	NEG	PMC5284348.xml	S108	Results	NEG	In between these two extremes, iaTreg cells displayed some degree of overlap with arthritis-associated synovial Teff and blood CPLs.
SEMI	NEG	PMC5284348.xml	S134	Discussion	NEG	As such, the identification of arthritis-associated clonotypes will likely require de novo investigations of immune features distinctive of each subject.
SEMI	NEG	PMC5284350.xml	S3	Objective	NEG	The basic leucine zipper transcription factor, ATF-like (BATF), a member of the Activator protein-1 family, promotes transcriptional activation or repression, depending on the interacting partners (JUN-B or C-JUN).
SEMI	NEG	PMC5284350.xml	S55	Results	NEG	Stimulation of chondrocytes with IL-1β, IL-6 or TNF-α and BATF overexpression did not affect IRF4 protein levels (figure 3D), whereas IRF8 was not detectable under our experimental conditions (data not shown).
SEMI	NEG	PMC5284350.xml	S79	Results	NEG	To explore the potential of BATF as a therapeutic target of OA, we examined whether inhibition of BATF/JUN affects catabolic factor expression and subsequent OA pathogenesis.
SEMI	NEG	PMC5284350.xml	S107	Discussion	NEG	Alternatively, it is possible that BATF induction by proinflammatory cytokines is accompanied by mechanosensitive induction of JUN-B and C-JUN to initiate cartilage destruction in Batf TG mice.
SEMI	NEG	PMC5284474.xml	S9		NEG	Glucocorticoids are essential stress hormones that regulate metabolic, cardiovascular and immunological homeostasis.
SEMI	NEG	PMC5284474.xml	S22		NEG	Once established, the cortisol circadian rhythm is similar through childhood and into adult life with minimal reported differences with age and puberty.
SEMI	NEG	PMC5284474.xml	S64		NEG	Some regimens leave children and adults with low concentrations of cortisol over the evening, and with most current regimens cortisol concentrations fall to undetectable levels overnight, and do not rise again until the first dose of hydrocortisone has been absorbed.
SEMI	NEG	PMC5284474.xml	S106		NEG	Many of the symptoms that patients with adrenal insufficiency complain of such as fatigue, sleep disturbance and poor concentration are seen when the cortisol circadian rhythm is disrupted in jetlag.
SEMI	NEG	PMC5284475.xml	S38	Methods	NEG	Patients were asked to specify if the treatment change was due to a hospitalisation or other physician visit, or at their own initiative.
SEMI	NEG	PMC5284475.xml	S51	Methods	NEG	Change from DAPT was entered in the model as a time-updated categorical variable that enters the model on the day of change from DAPT.12
SEMI	NEG	PMC5284475.xml	S72	Results	NEG	By the end of follow-up, 559 (5.7%) patients had died, and 978 patients (9.8%) experienced 1173 CV events, of which 653 were coronary, including 252 myocardial infarctions (MIs) (table 3, see online supplementary figure).
SEMI	NEG	PMC5284475.xml	S97	Discussion	NEG	Whether these factors are cultural, economic or related to organisational factors within local healthcare systems, requires further investigation.
SEMI	NEG	PMC5284481.xml	S17	Introduction	NEG	The score ranges from 0 to 9, and assigns 1 or 2 points for each stroke risk factor.1
SEMI	NEG	PMC5284481.xml	S22	Introduction	NEG	Primary care accounts for over 40% of initial AF diagnoses.6
SEMI	NEG	PMC5284481.xml	S42	Methods	NEG	In order to define non-valvular AF we then excluded individuals with a record of mitral valve disease, rheumatic mitral regurgitation, and prosthetic mitral, aortic or unspecified valve replacements,21 based on 45 Read codes, 9 ICD–10 codes and 11 operation and procedure codes (see online supplementary table S1 for the code list).
SEMI	NEG	PMC5284481.xml	S53	Methods	NEG	This allowed each individual's follow-up time to be divided into periods with and without use of warfarin.23
SEMI	NEG	PMC5284481.xml	S70	Methods	NEG	We used the formula: (IS ratewithout warfarin−IS ratewith warfarin)−1.5 (HS ratewith warfarin−HS ratewithout warfarin), whereby a positive estimate indicates a treatment benefit, and a negative estimate indicates treatment harm.27
SEMI	NEG	PMC5284481.xml	S94	Results	NEG	Only 15 (1.1%) individuals with initial record of diagnosis in primary care were reclassified from CHA2DS2-VASc=0 to CHA2DS2-VASc≥1 and 81 (2.7%) from CHA2DS2-VASc=1 to CHA2DS2-VASc≥2.
SEMI	NEG	PMC5284481.xml	S112	Results	NEG	A significant positive NCB was observed from CHA2DS2-VASc≥2 in men (NCB (95% CI)/100 PY: 0.5 (0.1 to 0.9)) and from CHA2DS2-VASc≥3 in women (NCB (95% CI)/100 PY: 1.5 (1.1 to 1.9)).
SEMI	NEG	PMC5284481.xml	S131	Discussion	NEG	To our knowledge, this is the first NCB analysis of warfarin to date that includes both individuals with initial record of diagnosis in primary and secondary care.
SEMI	POS	PMC5284481.xml	S158	Discussion	POS	We were limited by the depth and completeness of clinical information currently recorded in primary and secondary care records, however, we minimised the impact of this by analysing multiple data sources, and adopting robust phenotypes for capturing individuals, risk factors and end points.
SEMI	POS	PMC5284481.xml	S159	Discussion	POS	An example of the value of CALIBER phenotypes comes from hypertension.
SEMI	POS	PMC5284481.xml	S160	Discussion	POS	As shown, the proportion of individuals with baseline hypertension rose significantly when information from diagnosis codes was supplemented with blood pressure measurements and prescriptions data.
SEMI	POS	PMC5284481.xml	S161	Discussion	POS	It is however still possible that some individuals, risk factors and end points may have been overlooked, but we consider the number affected to be minimal, and less than previous studies.
SEMI	POS	PMC5284481.xml	S162	Discussion	POS	While the lack of DOAC data may be considered a limitation of the present analysis, it should be noted that warfarin remains the most widely used oral anticoagulant.
SEMI	POS	PMC5284481.xml	S163	Discussion	POS	Therefore, studies involving pre-DOAC era cohorts such as this are still shown to be of contemporary relevance.
SEMI	POS	PMC5284481.xml	S164	Discussion	POS	Lastly, though we included a large sample size of 70 000 individuals, we found that only a quarter of the overall population had CHA2DS2-VASc scores 0, 1 and 2.
SEMI	POS	PMC5284481.xml	S165	Discussion	POS	We therefore cannot rule out the possibility that a positive NCB of warfarin may be observed at CHA2DS2-VASc=1 given a larger study population.
SEMI	NEG	PMC5284484.xml	S33		NEG	CFD can be used to accurately predict the non-invasive pressure gradient across the CoA site without the limitations of simplified assumptions (eg, modified Bernoulli equation in echocardiography), showing good agreement with invasive catheter measurements, and further simulating aortic haemodynamics during stress testing.11
SEMI	NEG	PMC5284484.xml	S38		NEG	Minimally invasive interventional procedures can benefit from patient-specific predictions for preprocedural assessment, when the operator lacks direct access to the implantation site, choosing the type and size of device based mainly on imaging data.
SEMI	NEG	PMC5284484.xml	S49		NEG	A rigorous validation framework based on a large number of cases should be advocated to demonstrate the reliability of the models.
SEMI	NEG	PMC5284484.xml	S107		NEG	Furthermore, a multiscale approach can also be used to model phenomena such as blood clot formation,45 which can be relevant in CHD simulations.
SEMI	NEG	PMC5284486.xml	S11	Objectives	NEG	Group 2: 55 patients with sCJD treated with oral doxycycline were analysed and compared with 33 controls by a stratified propensity score applied to a Cox proportional hazard analysis.

SEMI	NEG	PMC5284486.xml	S120	Results	NEG	For the methionine/valine heterozygous (MV) genotype, the survival time is longer, with 365 days in the non-treated patients with sCJD and 391 days in treated sCJD (HR 0.83).
SEMI	NEG	PMC5284486.xml	S140	Discussion	NEG	With this, our study is in line with the observations made in the British and American US studies.
SEMI	NEG	PMC5286795.xml	S89	Methods	NEG	OTUs were annotated with taxonomic information using the 16SrRNA gene sequence database, GreenGene database, (http://greengenes.lbl.gov/cgi-bin/nph-index.cgi) [20] and the RDP Classifier (Version 2.2, http://sourceforge.net/projects/rdp-classifier/) [21].
SEMI	NEG	PMC5286795.xml	S183	Discussion	NEG	Our results showed that P. acnes were exclusively present in sarcoidosis samples, and both P. acnes and P. granulosum were not detected in the TB and control groups.
SEMI	NEG	PMC5286795.xml	S186	Discussion	NEG	Kouji Iio et al. used heat-inactivated P. acnes and Freund's complete adjuvant to induce pulmonary granuloma in mice, and found that the total number of lymphocytes and the ratio of CD4+ to CD8+ T cells in the bronchoalveolar lavage fluid of the mice with pulmonary granuloma were higher than those of the control mice [39].
SEMI	NEG	PMC5286795.xml	S191	Discussion	NEG	Compared with quantitative PCR approach, high throughput16SrRNA gene sequencing is a more effective approach to investigate bacterial profile of biopsy specimens and identify the predominant bacterial species in the specimens.
SEMI	NEG	PMC5287936.xml	S36	Methods	NEG	The details of the relationships are described in Table 1.
SEMI	NEG	PMC5287936.xml	S50	Methods	NEG	Intraoperative ultrasound was routinely used to confirm adequate hepatic venous anatomy and to verify the transaction plan before donor hepatectomy.
SEMI	NEG	PMC5287936.xml	S62	Methods	NEG	If the biliary graft contained a single duct, duct-to-duct anastomosis was the preferred method for biliary reconstruction.
SEMI	NEG	PMC5287936.xml	S182	Discussion	NEG	This high rate of biliary leakage might be associated with the surgical procedure when performing dissection of the periductal tissues, which can influence the blood supplies of the donor and recipient bile ducts.
SEMI	NEG	PMC5287937.xml	S6	Abstract	NEG	A retrospective review of 34 patients with PAs who received adjuvant CK SRS between 2006 and 2013 was performed.
SEMI	NEG	PMC5287937.xml	S79	Materials and methods	NEG	The parameters included in the analysis were age, sex, initial follow-up time, SRS parameters, endocrine function, cavernous sinus invasion, preoperative apoplexy, and initial volume.
SEMI	NEG	PMC5287937.xml	S219	Discussion	NEG	However, a 10-month dataset below the fitting curve was potentially correlated with eventual volume control.
SEMI	NEG	PMC5287937.xml	S220	Discussion	NEG	For the exponential fitting model constructed with only 3 datasets, the relative position of the 3 points was either below-above-below (triangular) or above-below-above (inverted triangular) (Fig. 7).
SEMI	NEG	PMC5287937.xml	S230	Discussion	NEG	However, an exponential model is not always valid for all individual tumors, and many factors need to be considered including cell cycle time, growth fraction, availability of oxygen, cell proliferation rate, cell loss rate, and tumor-related systemic factors.[43–47]
SEMI	POS	PMC5287937.xml	S238	Discussion	POS	As noted above, only two patients ultimately had progression, limiting the accuracy of the time course estimation and the application of the exponential fitting model in those patients.
SEMI	POS	PMC5287937.xml	S239	Discussion	POS	There were also technical limitations secondary to a retrospective image analysis.
SEMI	POS	PMC5287937.xml	S240	Discussion	POS	Different image sequences (axial, coronal, or sagittal), slice thicknesses or doses of contrast injection can cause variability.

SEMI	POS	PMC5287937.xml	S242	Discussion	POS	Furthermore, an irregular shape and smaller number of slices have been correlated with increased errors.[48]
SEMI	NEG	PMC5287938.xml	S39	Methods	NEG	This study was conducted in the South African township of Orange Farm where the adult population (18–49 years) is estimated to be 110,000.
SEMI	NEG	PMC5287938.xml	S50	Methods	NEG	In these 870 households, 696 men were eligible and 522 men accepted to participate in the study, which corresponds to an individual response rate of 75.0%.
SEMI	NEG	PMC5287938.xml	S82	Methods	NEG	To assess the effect on VMMC uptake of other concurrency factors than those forming the intervention, such as TV shows or male circumcision campaigns in the township, we also recorded the level of VMMC performed on adult men living in Orange Farm during the course of the study and not recruited in the intervention study.
SEMI	NEG	PMC5287938.xml	S95	Methods	NEG	The covariates with an univariate P value <0.2 were included in the multivariate analysis.
SEMI	NEG	PMC5287938.xml	S110	Results	NEG	To the question “Are you willing to become circumcised in the future?” asked before being exposed to the intervention, 186/212 (87.7%; 95% CI: 82.8%–91.6%) chose the answer “Yes, definitely”, 21/212 (9.9%; 95% CI: 6.4%–14.5%) chose the answer “Maybe”, and 5/212 (2.4%; 95% CI: 0.9%–5.1%) chose “Unlikely” or “Definitely not”.
SEMI	NEG	PMC5287938.xml	S122	Results	NEG	The initial male circumcision prevalence rate was significantly different from 80% (P < 0.001), which was not the case for the final male circumcision prevalence rate (P = 0.44).
SEMI	NEG	PMC5287938.xml	S127	Results	NEG	Among the 148 men who came for circumcision, 31 (20.9%; 95% CI: 15.0%–28.0%) were tested for HIV for the first time at the VMMC clinic.
SEMI	NEG	PMC5287938.xml	S140	Results	NEG	Among those who opted for circumcision, 124/142 (87.3%; 95% CI: 81.1%–92.0%) reported that they would not have been circumcised without the discussions with male circumcision advisers together with the financial compensation.
SEMI	POS	PMC5287938.xml	S155	Discussion	POS	The main limitation of this study is that we used an evaluation method in which the male circumcision prevalence rate after the intervention was compared with the value before the intervention.
SEMI	POS	PMC5287938.xml	S156	Discussion	POS	Therefore, the observed increase of male circumcision prevalence rate may be attributable to other concurrency factors than those forming the intervention, such as TV shows or male circumcision campaigns in the township.
SEMI	POS	PMC5287938.xml	S157	Discussion	POS	To assess this possibility, we carefully recorded the level of VMMC performed on adult men living in Orange Farm during the course of the study and not recruited in the intervention study.
SEMI	POS	PMC5287938.xml	S158	Discussion	POS	The result was that we can consider that most of the 129 VMMCs performed in this study are confidently attributable to the intervention.
SEMI	POS	PMC5287938.xml	S159	Discussion	POS	Another important argument in favor of a causal interpretation of our study is that most of men (87.3%) of this study who came for circumcision reported that they would not have come without the motivational interviews and the financial compensation, which were key components of the intervention.
SEMI	POS	PMC5287938.xml	S160	Discussion	POS	Another limitation of this study is the response rate, even if the rates obtained are acceptable for such a study.
SEMI	POS	PMC5287938.xml	S161	Discussion	POS	From reports provided by fieldworkers having conducted the preliminary discussion in the selected households before inclusion, about 45% of the men who refused to participate were men not willing to have a genital examination.
SEMI	POS	PMC5287938.xml	S162	Discussion	POS	Because the intervention study was proposed only to men who accepted the genital examination, there is no reason to think that such a refusal is linked to the male circumcision status of those who refused to participate.
SEMI	POS	PMC5287938.xml	S163	Discussion	POS	However, we cannot determine what would have been the result of the study without including a genital examination.
SEMI	NEG	PMC5287938.xml	S175	Discussion	NEG	We designed our intervention based on the following principles: the men have to make minimum effort; the intervention should focus on repeated motivational interviews that allow for private discussion in a respectful manner of the reasons given by each man for not being circumcised; discussion with friends, relatives, and partners are important in the decision making process; and financial compensation for time encourages those who may not be able to afford to take time off work to undergo VMMC.
SEMI	NEG	PMC5287939.xml	S22	Introduction	NEG	Chronic moderate physical exercise promotes a decrease in the concentration of endotoxin and regulates the pro/anti-inflammatory balance, partially reversing the inflammation that occurs in obesity.[2]
SEMI	NEG	PMC5287939.xml	S35	Materials and methods	NEG	Noninclusion criteria included the presence of cardiovascular pathologies or other diseases diagnosed during the clinical evaluation that interfered with the response to exercise or study results.
SEMI	NEG	PMC5287939.xml	S60	Materials and methods	NEG	This parameter was measured with a finger oximeter (FingerPulse®, Beijing, China).
SEMI	NEG	PMC5287939.xml	S102	Discussion	NEG	One could speculate that the increase in endotoxin concentration contributes to the increased migration of macrophages to the gastrointestinal tract, resulting in increased pro-inflammatory cytokines and GI disturbances including nausea, diarrhea, and bleeding.
SEMI	NEG	PMC5287940.xml	S55	Patients and methods	NEG	In the case of lap-CBS, after parenchymal dissection, endoscopic linear stapler (Endo GIA Curved Tip Reload with Tri-Staple with iDrive Ultra Powered Stapling System; Medtronic, Minneapolis, MN) with 60 mm tan cartridge was used to ligate the middle hepatic vein.
SEMI	NEG	PMC5287940.xml	S99	Discussion	NEG	The median follow-up period was 25.3 months of our enrolled patients and only 1 case has tumor recurred.
SEMI	POS	PMC5287940.xml	S101	Discussion	POS	But, the present study had several limitations.
SEMI	POS	PMC5287940.xml	S102	Discussion	POS	The number of cases was small; therefore, additional studies should be performed to further verify the safety and feasibility of LH for centrally located tumors through a comparative study with OH and a larger number of cases.

SEMI	NEG	PMC5287941.xml	S205	Discussion	NEG	This phenomenon could result in an older age of data collection in the treated group.
SEMI	NEG	PMC5287941.xml	S233	Discussion	NEG	We also compared the clinical features and treatment status of our patients with those from foreign countries.
SEMI	NEG	PMC5287942.xml	S8	Abstract	NEG	A 55-year-old, right-handed man was admitted to our hospital with sudden receptive aphasia and right-sided hypoalgesia.

SEMI	NEG	PMC5287942.xml	S70	Discussion	NEG	The PSV on the second day after the stroke was extremely high, reaching 290 cm/s, then declining over time, and returning to normal at day 30 (120 cm/s).
SEMI	NEG	PMC5287942.xml	S80	Discussion	NEG	Medical management is indicated for symptom control.
SEMI	NEG	PMC5287943.xml	S26	Introduction	NEG	Over 90% cardiogenic emboli were identified from the left atrial appendage (LAA) in patients with nonvalvular AF.[2]
SEMI	NEG	PMC5287943.xml	S69	Methods	NEG	The cardiac CT images of patients received catheter-based LAA closure were collected and analyzed in order to measure the size of the orifice and the depth of the LAAs.
SEMI	NEG	PMC5287943.xml	S88	Methods	NEG	The closure device was finally selected by the interventional cardiologist together with on-site fluoroscopy and 3D TEE evaluation thereafter.
SEMI	NEG	PMC5287943.xml	S93	Methods	NEG	The position of the transport sheath in the LAA was confirmed under the guidance of RT-3D TEE.
SEMI	NEG	PMC5287943.xml	S101	Methods	NEG	The left atrial volume and the LVEF were evaluated.
SEMI	POS	PMC5287943.xml	S167	Discussion	POS	Conventional 2D TEE is not adequate to display the morphology of LAA through multiple views as it can only display the LAA section by section due to technical limitations.
SEMI	POS	PMC5287943.xml	S168	Discussion	POS	Therefore, it is difficult to precisely determine the number of lobes and the maximal dimension of LAA ostium, which hampers the planning and accomplishing of a closure procedure in patients with a multi-lobed LAA.
SEMI	POS	PMC5287943.xml	S169	Discussion	POS	Unlike the conventional 2D TEE, the 3D TEE is convenient to obtain the full volume data and the presence of lobe in the LAA.[15]
SEMI	POS	PMC5287943.xml	S170	Discussion	POS	Our study indicated RT-3D TEE was effective for the LAA closure in clinical practice, which was mainly featured by accurate determination of the morphology and number of LAA orifice, the position of massive trabecular muscles in the cavity of atrial appendage, as well as the landing zone of the LAA.
SEMI	POS	PMC5287943.xml	S171	Discussion	POS	Compared with the 2D TEE, RT-3D TEE brings about more information about the anatomical structure of the LAA, which is helpful for the selection of closure device.
SEMI	POS	PMC5287943.xml	S172	Discussion	POS	Meanwhile, the En-face view of the closure device after placement could be provided by RT-3D TEE, together with the position of the device in the heart chamber and the location between the adjacent structures.
SEMI	POS	PMC5287943.xml	S173	Discussion	POS	All these contribute to the evaluation of closure in an accurate manner.
SEMI	NEG	PMC5287943.xml	S193	Discussion	NEG	Such technique could effectively eliminate the measurement error and provide strong evidence supporting the selection of a particular device.
SEMI	NEG	PMC5287943.xml	S213	Discussion	NEG	In addition, 3D TEE involves a very skillful operation to ensure fast reconstruction of high quality image; otherwise, it would be time-consuming and may slow down the whole procedures.
SEMI	NEG	PMC5287945.xml	S20	Patients and methods	NEG	Patients were positive to HCV Ab and negative by qualitative PCR test were excluded from the study.

SEMI	NEG	PMC5287947.xml	S88	Results	NEG	Functional enrichment analysis was performed separately for the GC stage-specific genes, and the results were shown in Fig. 2.
SEMI	NEG	PMC5287947.xml	S91	Results	NEG	Additionally, the stage-specific genes in stage IV GC samples were dramatically enriched in functions, including vasculature development, skeletal system development, and urogential system development.
SEMI	NEG	PMC5287947.xml	S121	Discussion	NEG	Besides, by performing Motif Scanning, the author also screened out some key TFs for different stage-specific genes, which can bind the promoter sequence of most stage-specific genes.

SEMI	NEG	PMC5287953.xml	S77	Results	NEG	As shown in Table 2, asthma was found in 105 out of 664 (15.8%) children with HFMD and 1342 out of 6751 (19.9%) children who had not been infected with this disease.
SEMI	NEG	PMC5287953.xml	S98	Discussion	NEG	This finding suggests that enteroviruses may affect the immune system in such a way that influences the subsequent risks of allergic diseases.
SEMI	NEG	PMC5287953.xml	S103	Discussion	NEG	Therefore, prematurity or low birth weight may significantly influence the risk of the subsequent development of allergic diseases; these 2 factors are presented as ICD 765 and have been adjusted in this study.
SEMI	NEG	PMC5287953.xml	S112	Discussion	NEG	This study's results revealed that herpangina and HFMD have differing influences on the subsequent risk of developing an allergic disease.

SEMI	NEG	PMC5287956.xml	S87	Discussion	NEG	First, the current study was a retrospective design with a small size population.
SEMI	NEG	PMC5287957.xml	S3	Abstract	NEG	Metastatic pheochromocytoma in the spine is rare, and there is no standard curative management.
SEMI	NEG	PMC5287957.xml	S16	Introduction	NEG	Previous reports investigating treatment methods for malignant tumor in the spine have studied preoperative embolization of vascular supply, chemotherapy and/or radiotherapy, and/or tumor resection,[3] and concluded that open curative resection of the sectional lesion was effective.
SEMI	NEG	PMC5287957.xml	S18	Introduction	NEG	Herein, we present 2 cases in which pheochromocytoma of the spine was successfully treated via osteoplasty by cement augmentation for the first time; this method deactivated the neuroendocrine systems, reduced perioperative blood loss, and stabilized the spine.
SEMI	NEG	PMC5287957.xml	S32	Case reports	NEG	The lesions were protruding into the spinal canal and causing lumbar canal stenosis.
SEMI	NEG	PMC5287959.xml	S21	Introduction	NEG	The corpus callosum contains numerous neural fibers connecting the bilateral cerebral hemispheres, and LA displays symmetrical changes.
SEMI	NEG	PMC5287959.xml	S22	Introduction	NEG	Thus, our previous study attempted to investigate the relationship between the network connectivity of corpus callosum and LA, and results indicated that the abnormal conductivity of the corpus callosum was closely related to the pathogenesis of LA as well as the cognition impairment.[1]
SEMI	NEG	PMC5287959.xml	S24	Introduction	NEG	Exogenously administered citicoline can promote rapid repair of injured neuronal membrane by increasing the synthesis of phospholipids.
SEMI	NEG	PMC5287959.xml	S100	Discussion	NEG	Currently, the causal relationship between network change of the corpus callosum and LA is still unclear.
SEMI	NEG	PMC5287960.xml	S7	Abstract	NEG	We present a 62-year-old patient with RCH encountered following surgical clipping of an unruptured middle cerebral artery bifurcation aneurysm in a patient with previous cerebellar infarction.
SEMI	NEG	PMC5287960.xml	S34	Case report	NEG	Follow-up head CT scan performed 20 hours after surgery revealed bilateral RCH with a “zebra sign” (Fig. 1C and D).
SEMI	NEG	PMC5287960.xml	S37	Case report	NEG	Emergency posterior fossa decompression and external ventricular drainage were performed but he died 14 days later.
SEMI	NEG	PMC5287960.xml	S53	Discussion	NEG	On a retrospective review of this patient, there were several points contributing to the occurrence of fulminant RCH—first, as is well known, loss of a large volume of CSF.
SEMI	NEG	PMC5287961.xml	S9	Abstract	NEG	Median PFS was 3.7 months (95% confidence interval [CI], 1.3–6.1 months) and median OS was 10.0 months (95% CI, 6.6–13.5).
SEMI	NEG	PMC5287961.xml	S119	Discussion	NEG	In addition, a few trials have reported that VIP shows favorable outcomes in patients with recurrent solid tumors and hematological malignancies.[27,28]
SEMI	NEG	PMC5287961.xml	S137	Discussion	NEG	In conclusion, although the small number of patients and retrospective nature of the study are major limitations, the VIP combination might be active in patients with previously treated STS.
SEMI	NEG	PMC5287961.xml	S141	Acknowledgments	NEG	The patient data reported herein were derived from a follow-up study approved by the Institutional Review Board of Chungnam National University Hospital, and patients signed appropriate informed consent forms for therapy.
SEMI	NEG	PMC5287962.xml	S17	Introduction	NEG	No consensus exists regarding the etiology of Chiari malformations.
SEMI	NEG	PMC5287962.xml	S52	Methods	NEG	The details reviewed from medical records reviewed included sex, age, symptom duration, the total duration of the hospital stay, the duration of the postoperative hospital stay, and preoperative symptoms.
SEMI	NEG	PMC5287962.xml	S60	Methods	NEG	CM-I was stratified into 3 subgroups according to the cerebellar tonsillar descent (CTD)[17,19] as follows: grade 1, the tonsil descended more than 5 mm below the foramen magnum but did not reach the C1 arch; grade 2, the tonsil reached the C1 arch; and grade 3, the tonsil descended over the C1 arch (Fig. 1).
SEMI	NEG	PMC5287962.xml	S168	Discussion	NEG	However, according to McGirt et al, in children with displacement of the tonsils below the inferior border of the arch of the atlas, ultrasonography-indicated osseous decompression alone was associated with a 2-fold risk of symptom recurrence compared to decompression with duraplasty.[34]
SEMI	POS	PMC5287962.xml	S183	Limitations	POS	The present study has all of the limitations of any retrospective study design.
SEMI	POS	PMC5287962.xml	S184	Limitations	POS	The results of this study should be interpreted with caution.
SEMI	POS	PMC5287962.xml	S185	Limitations	POS	A prospective multicenter study with a large and equal number of patients in the PFD and PFDD groups might provide sufficient data for an adequate comparison of these 2 techniques to better define the indications and benefits.
SEMI	POS	PMC5287962.xml	S186	Limitations	POS	Also the follow-up evaluation is needed to be replaced by a more objective method in the further study.
SEMI	NEG	PMC5287963.xml	S31	Case presentation	NEG	At the time of CIN3 diagnosis, the patient was on a HAART regimen including stavudine, nelfinavir, and lamivudine; the plasma viral load was undetectable (< 20 copies/mL) and the CD4 T-cell count was 350 cell/μL.
SEMI	NEG	PMC5287963.xml	S62	Case presentation	NEG	The PET/CT scan showed a strong FDG uptake by the distal rectum and anorectal junction.
SEMI	NEG	PMC5287963.xml	S82	Discussion	NEG	Interestingly, our patient had multiple cancers despite good virological response, confirming that the immune restoration by HAART does not seem to minimize the burden of HPV-related cancers in HIV-positive patients.
SEMI	NEG	PMC5287963.xml	S84	Discussion	NEG	In particular, the increased incidence of anal cancer in HIV-positive patients is currently a matter of concern.
SEMI	NEG	PMC5287964.xml	S5	Abstract	NEG	Pseudoprogression, that is, initial tumor growth followed by subsequent tumor regression, has been well described for immunomodulation therapy in melanoma patients.
SEMI	NEG	PMC5287964.xml	S26	Introduction	NEG	Pseudoprogression has been reported in 6.7% to 12% of patients with malignant melanoma treated by immunotherapy,[3] while the manifestation of this phenomenon in lung cancer is still uncertain.
SEMI	NEG	PMC5287964.xml	S35	Case presentation	NEG	She received one cycle of carboplatin and gemcitabine followed by severe pancytopenia, and treatment was switched to nivolumab 3 mg/kg q14 days in January 2015.
SEMI	NEG	PMC5287964.xml	S46	Discussion	NEG	Specifically, initial tumor growth followed by subsequent tumor regression (“pseudoprogression”) has been reported in metastatic melanoma.
SEMI	NEG	PMC5287967.xml	S4	Abstract	NEG	We report on a patient who developed aggravation of excessive daytime sleepiness (EDS) concurrent with aggravation of an injured ascending reticular activating system (ARAS) following mild traumatic brain injury (TBI), demonstrated by follow-up diffusion tensor tractographies (DTTs).
SEMI	NEG	PMC5287967.xml	S21	Introduction	NEG	Because EDS is related to poor daytime function, elucidation of its pathogenetic mechanism is important.[2]
SEMI	NEG	PMC5287967.xml	S24	Introduction	NEG	In the present study, we report on a patient who developed aggravation of EDS concurrent with aggravation of an injured ARAS following mild TBI, demonstrated by serial DTTs.
SEMI	NEG	PMC5287967.xml	S41	Case report	NEG	The Oxford Centre for Functional Magnetic Resonance Imaging of the Brain (FMRIB) Software Library was used for analysis of DTI data.
SEMI	NEG	PMC5287969.xml	S24	Introduction	NEG	Ving Tsun (VT) or Wing Chun, a hard-style Chinese martial art and a whole-body strengthening exercise, is a high-impact combat sport, the popularity of which has been increasing among younger and older adults worldwide.[10]
SEMI	NEG	PMC5287969.xml	S80	Methods	NEG	The standardized testing procedures recommended by the manufacturer were followed.[19]
SEMI	NEG	PMC5287969.xml	S81	Methods	NEG	The testing range of motion was the participant's full knee flexion–extension range and a test velocity of 60°/second was adopted.
SEMI	NEG	PMC5287969.xml	S101	Methods	NEG	To compare the outcome parameters between the 3 groups while controlling for an inflation of type I error associated with multiple t tests, multivariate analysis of variance (MANOVA) was performed for each category of outcomes (ie, upper limb musculoskeletal outcomes, lower limb musculoskeletal outcomes, and trunk musculoskeletal outcomes).
SEMI	NEG	PMC5287969.xml	S112	Results	NEG	The results revealed that the VT group had a higher total radius BMD (11.5%) than the control group (P = 0.023), whereas MANOVA results showed no significant difference in the upper limb muscle outcomes between the 2 groups (Hotelling trace = 0.042; F(2, 51) = 1.083; P = 0.346) (Table 3).
SEMI	NEG	PMC5287969.xml	S115	Results	NEG	No significant between-group differences were observed for any of the other lower limb musculoskeletal outcomes (P > 0.05).
SEMI	NEG	PMC5287969.xml	S146	Discussion	NEG	However, why such an improvement was not observed in the knee extensor muscles is still not known.
SEMI	NEG	PMC5287969.xml	S148	Discussion	NEG	With regard to the lumbar spine BMD and trunk lean (muscle) mass, VT practitioners did not differ from the controls because VT training focuses on body positioning rather than trunk/core strength development or loading the vertebral column.[10,11]
SEMI	POS	PMC5287969.xml	S150	Discussion	POS	This study has several limitations.
SEMI	POS	PMC5287969.xml	S151	Discussion	POS	First, a cross-sectional study design was employed and a cause-and-effect relationship between VT training and the musculoskeletal outcomes could not be established.
SEMI	POS	PMC5287969.xml	S152	Discussion	POS	A randomized controlled trial will be necessary to confirm the aforementioned beneficial effects of VT training in middle-aged and older adults.
SEMI	POS	PMC5287969.xml	S153	Discussion	POS	Second, we did not take 3 potential confounding factors – family history of osteoporosis,[29] dietary habits, and lifestyle[30] – into account when analyzing the BMD results.
SEMI	POS	PMC5287969.xml	S154	Discussion	POS	Third, our results may not be generalizable to elderly or diseased populations.
SEMI	POS	PMC5287969.xml	S155	Discussion	POS	Fourth, our participants’ length of VT training varied from 1 to 40 years.
SEMI	POS	PMC5287969.xml	S156	Discussion	POS	Further studies should control this factor to document the physical changes during specific time periods.
SEMI	POS	PMC5287969.xml	S157	Discussion	POS	Finally, further exploration is warranted into the relationship between VT, musculoskeletal health, and health-related quality of life in the aging population.
SEMI	NEG	PMC5287970.xml	S59	Case report	NEG	The tumor invaded the fat tissues surrounding the head of pancreas.
SEMI	NEG	PMC5287970.xml	S92	Discussion	NEG	Based on pathological diagnosis, 2 or more malignant components are required for carcinoma diagnosis.
SEMI	NEG	PMC5287970.xml	S99	Discussion	NEG	The mechanism of carcinosarcoma is unclear.
SEMI	NEG	PMC5287970.xml	S106	Discussion	NEG	Radical resection is the best option for patients contraindicated for surgery.
SEMI	NEG	PMC5287971.xml	S16	Introduction	NEG	According to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, 1,700,000 individuals sustained traumatic brain injury (TBI) annually in the USA between 2002 and 2006.[1] Of those, 1,365,000 (80.7%) attended emergency departments, 275,000 (16.3%) were admitted and 52,000 (3.0%) died.
SEMI	NEG	PMC5287971.xml	S40	Introduction	NEG	In addition, even when patients are employed, rehabilitation support should be offered at workplace.
SEMI	NEG	PMC5287971.xml	S51	Methods	NEG	Figure 2 depicts the subject selection flowchart.
SEMI	NEG	PMC5287971.xml	S52	Methods	NEG	In the 1st step, the database at the university hospital rehabilitation department was used to identify 206 consecutive TBI patients who had been referred for rehabilitation intervention between November 2006 and October 2011.
SEMI	NEG	PMC5287971.xml	S75	Methods	NEG	Seven factors, including amnesia (9 items) and executive function (4 items), are extracted through factor analysis.
SEMI	NEG	PMC5287971.xml	S76	Methods	NEG	The standard deviation for control subjects is used as the measurement unit, with scores for each factor expressed as z values and healthy individuals’ mean scores for each factor designated as the zero point.
SEMI	NEG	PMC5287971.xml	S101	Methods	NEG	Consent for prospective chronic-phase rehabilitation intervention was obtained from the subjects, and the services were implemented based on subjects’ specific rehabilitation needs.
SEMI	NEG	PMC5287971.xml	S107	Methods	NEG	Rehabilitation intervention outcomes were assessed according to differences between the scores for variables in the initial interview and additional assessment.
SEMI	NEG	PMC5287971.xml	S191	Results	NEG	Case 1: Male (age at injury; 18 years old, motorcycle accident).
SEMI	NEG	PMC5287971.xml	S195	Results	NEG	GCS at the time of the L1-TC import was E1V2M2.
SEMI	NEG	PMC5287971.xml	S220	Results	NEG	Memory disturbance was remarkable, but the recent memory was kept.
SEMI	POS	PMC5287971.xml	S271	Discussion	POS	Cultural and social differences between Japan and Australia should have been considered when translating the original English SPRS-2 into Japanese.
SEMI	POS	PMC5287971.xml	S272	Discussion	POS	However, because this would have required additional research, and the sample size was small, these differences were not explored.
SEMI	POS	PMC5287971.xml	S273	Discussion	POS	In addition, the actual number of subjects did not match the sample size.
SEMI	POS	PMC5287971.xml	S274	Discussion	POS	Because this was a mixed-methods study involving qualitative data collection, it was difficult to perform a clinical study involving numerous subjects.
SEMI	POS	PMC5287971.xml	S275	Discussion	POS	Nevertheless, the number of subjects should be increased to reduce type I and II errors in future.
SEMI	POS	PMC5287971.xml	S276	Discussion	POS	It was difficult to obtain accurate information in a single semistructured interview with TBI patients with cognitive dysfunction, because they engaged in circumlocution and deviated from the point.
SEMI	POS	PMC5287971.xml	S277	Discussion	POS	In particular, statements of participants relating to rehabilitation needs were often some ambiguity.
SEMI	POS	PMC5287971.xml	S278	Discussion	POS	Therefore, for confirming their rehabilitation needs, it was necessary to check the verbatim record or to conduct re-interview in some cases.
SEMI	POS	PMC5287971.xml	S279	Discussion	POS	This necessitated the repetition of interviews, which increased the possibility of bias such as that involving interviewers’ opinions.
SEMI	POS	PMC5287971.xml	S280	Discussion	POS	In qualitative studies involving conversational data, it is important to use study methods that minimize bias in the analyst.
SEMI	POS	PMC5287971.xml	S281	Discussion	POS	Sufficient discussion regarding mismatched concepts/categories and computer software was necessary.
SEMI	NEG	PMC5287972.xml	S22	Introduction	NEG	As a result, frozen section diagnosis during surgery is very meaningful to both doctors and patients, guiding subsequent surgery steps and preventing patients from having to undergo a second surgery.
SEMI	NEG	PMC5287972.xml	S48	Patients and methods	NEG	The impedances of tissue vary with the frequency of the current.
SEMI	NEG	PMC5287972.xml	S49	Patients and methods	NEG	A specific instrument can calculate the impedance from the voltage and current.
SEMI	NEG	PMC5287972.xml	S89	Results	NEG	Therefore, the Cole-Cole curves were not an ideal diagnostic model.
SEMI	NEG	PMC5287972.xml	S127	Discussion	NEG	In our diagnostic model, we found a trend that a higher value of RF′ resulted in a lower possibility of being a benign tumor.
SEMI	POS	PMC5287972.xml	S148	Discussion	POS	Our study had some limitations.
SEMI	POS	PMC5287972.xml	S149	Discussion	POS	We tested an adequate number of patients to build the model, but more accurate criteria may need more specimens and multicenter trials.
SEMI	POS	PMC5287972.xml	S150	Discussion	POS	In addition, a verification test should be designed to judge the diagnostic power.
SEMI	POS	PMC5287972.xml	S151	Discussion	POS	Finally, the method was based on the intrinsic property of tumor tissues.
SEMI	POS	PMC5287972.xml	S152	Discussion	POS	Criteria-matching tumors with special types (e.g., mucinous carcinoma, medullary carcinoma) should be investigated.
SEMI	NEG	PMC5287973.xml	S39	Introduction	NEG	Therefore, we evaluated the clinical usefulness of Romo1 in pleural fluid as a potential diagnostic marker for lung cancer.
SEMI	NEG	PMC5287973.xml	S52	Materials and methods	NEG	This study was performed after obtaining written informed consent from all patients.
SEMI	NEG	PMC5287973.xml	S77	Results	NEG	The clinical characteristics of each group are summarized in Table 1.
SEMI	NEG	PMC5287973.xml	S91	Results	NEG	Median CEA and CYFRA 21-1 levels in lung cancer groups were 17.3 and 150.5 ng/mL, respectively, which were significantly higher than that in benign pleural effusions (P < 0.001, Table 1).
SEMI	NEG	PMC5287973.xml	S94	Results	NEG	ROC curve analysis was performed to determine the diagnostic performance and optimal cutoff value of pleural fluid Romo1 for lung cancer.
SEMI	NEG	PMC5287973.xml	S104	Results	NEG	In a pairwise comparison, CEA showed significantly better diagnostic performance than either Romo1 or CYFRA 21-1 (all P = 0.001) and Romo1 was significantly better diagnostic indicator than was CYFRA 21-1 (P = 0.01) (Fig. 3).
SEMI	NEG	PMC5287973.xml	S113	Discussion	NEG	In addition, we determined the usefulness of pleural fluid Romo1 as a potential diagnostic marker for lung cancer-associated malignant effusion.
SEMI	NEG	PMC5287973.xml	S138	Discussion	NEG	CEA is a glycoprotein component of glycocalyx of the endothermic epithelium and is present at a high degree in a wide variety of tumors.[18]
SEMI	NEG	PMC5287973.xml	S142	Discussion	NEG	Some studies have suggested that CEA is better than CYFRA 21-1 for the diagnosis of lung cancer-related malignant effusion.[8,18]
SEMI	POS	PMC5287973.xml	S148	Discussion	POS	This study has several limitations.
SEMI	POS	PMC5287973.xml	S149	Discussion	POS	First, the sample size was relatively small and large-scale studies are warranted to confirm our findings.
SEMI	POS	PMC5287973.xml	S150	Discussion	POS	Second, we did not collect paired serum samples.
SEMI	POS	PMC5287973.xml	S151	Discussion	POS	Simultaneous measurement of serum and pleural fluid Romo1 levels could enable us to find the association between Romo1 levels in the 2 types of body fluid, and would provide more information about which is more sensitive or reliable marker in determining pleural fluid etiology.
SEMI	POS	PMC5287973.xml	S152	Discussion	POS	However, based on a previous study showing that serum Romo1 expression was correlated with tissue Romo1 expression,[15] we could cautiously estimate that Romo1 level in pleural effusion could be related to that in serum.
SEMI	POS	PMC5287973.xml	S153	Discussion	POS	Third, we did not include malignant effusion of other types of tumor.
SEMI	POS	PMC5287973.xml	S154	Discussion	POS	It is because the purpose of this study was to elucidate the clinical significance of pleural fluid Romo1 in lung cancer, and we thought that our data provide fundamentals for the future studies investigating the potential usefulness of this protein in other malignancies.
SEMI	POS	PMC5287973.xml	S155	Discussion	POS	Fourth, although we demonstrated the diagnostic value of Romo1, we did not evaluate its possible association with prognosis simultaneously.
SEMI	POS	PMC5287973.xml	S156	Discussion	POS	However, we have recently demonstrated that tissue Romo1 expression was related to both poor response and prognosis in lung cancer patients who received platinum-based chemotherapy.[21]
SEMI	NEG	PMC5287974.xml	S13	Abstract	NEG	Follow-up coronary angiography 15 months later showed a restored normal Thrombolysis In Myocardial Infarction grade (TIMI) 3 flow.

SEMI	NEG	PMC5287974.xml	S28	Case report	NEG	Upon physical examination, his heart rate was 75 bpm and arterial blood pressure was 130/80 mm Hg.
SEMI	NEG	PMC5287974.xml	S43	Case report	NEG	Coronary computed tomographic angiography 10 days after admission showed CAE involving the LM and LCX and confirmed the presence of an occlusive intraluminal thrombus in the distal portion of the LCX (Fig. 3).
SEMI	NEG	PMC5287975.xml	S35	Methods	NEG	The primary cause of death was defined as the condition that led directly to death, excluding final events of a terminal disease.
SEMI	NEG	PMC5287975.xml	S59	Methods	NEG	Patients under palliative care are not systematically submitted to autopsies.
SEMI	NEG	PMC5287975.xml	S142	Discussion	NEG	When patients were categorized according to the status of ventricular function; patients with preserved ejection fraction had a higher proportion of female patients and were more likely to have arterial hypertension and rheumatic valvar disease as the etiology of HF.
SEMI	POS	PMC5287975.xml	S160	Conclusions	POS	As an autopsy-based study, it should be acknowledged that a natural selection bias might have occurred, because autopsies tend to be more frequently performed in patients with a higher degree of diagnostic uncertainty.
SEMI	POS	PMC5287975.xml	S161	Conclusions	POS	Furthermore, we could not retrieve clinical data for all patients who were autopsied.
SEMI	POS	PMC5287975.xml	S162	Conclusions	POS	The inclusion of a high number of patients with Chagas disease, and of a low number of patients with ischemic heart disease as compared to cohorts[32] and clinical trials[33] in other HF populations are important aspects to be acknowledged.
SEMI	NEG	PMC5287976.xml	S83	Methods	NEG	Third, the fluid dynamics Navier Stokes equation (ANSYS Workbench 14.5, ANSYS Inc, Canonsburg, PA) was used for iterative calculation, extraction, analysis, and visualization.
SEMI	NEG	PMC5287976.xml	S120	Results	NEG	There were 18 vascular lesions in the significantly calcified plaque group, of which lesions with FFR ≤0.80 accounted for 33.33% (n = 6).
SEMI	NEG	PMC5287976.xml	S175	Discussion	NEG	Because of the small sample size, our study analyzed diagnosis effectiveness based only on blood vessels rather than patients.
SEMI	NEG	PMC5287976.xml	S176	Discussion	NEG	Although the iFRCT threshold value for the diagnosis of functional stenosis was provided, data from a larger sample are needed to verify the results.
SEMI	NEG	PMC5287977.xml	S59	Materials and methods	NEG	Overall, 93 full-time attending physicians were involved in this study; 17 worked only in one tertiary referral medical center, and another 17 worked only in one secondary regional hospital.
SEMI	NEG	PMC5287977.xml	S92	Materials and methods	NEG	Significance testing was 2-sided, and the significance threshold was set at P < 0.05.
SEMI	NEG	PMC5287977.xml	S103	Results	NEG	As shown in Fig. 1A, B, there were statistically significant associations between resident seniority and emergency physician efficiency among urgent and nonurgent patients (P < 0.001 for both door-to-order time and door-to-disposition time, according to a Kruskal–Wallis test).
SEMI	NEG	PMC5287977.xml	S111	Results	NEG	Again, the analysis was stratified by disease acuity.
SEMI	NEG	PMC5287977.xml	S135	Discussion	NEG	However, clinical conditions among the same triage levels can vary, which can sometimes result in different outcomes.[13]
SEMI	NEG	PMC5287977.xml	S137	Discussion	NEG	On the other hand, in supervised visits with junior residents of nonurgent patients, there was a greater likelihood of ED observation.
SEMI	NEG	PMC5287977.xml	S147	Discussion	NEG	The urgent supervised visits with senior residents also resulted in more laboratory examinations than did attending-alone visits.
SEMI	POS	PMC5287977.xml	S153	Limitation	POS	The present study has several limitations.
SEMI	POS	PMC5287977.xml	S154	Limitation	POS	First, the 5 study sites belonged to the same medical system, which may limit generalization of the conclusions to other medical settings with different resident training models.
SEMI	POS	PMC5287977.xml	S155	Limitation	POS	Second, this study did not trace the patients’ outcomes after the end of the day shift, so it could not determine whether patient groups were over-or under-admitted.
SEMI	POS	PMC5287977.xml	S156	Limitation	POS	Third, the administrative data could not supply critical information on many aspects of care, such as the interpersonal quality, technical quality, or appropriateness of care received.
SEMI	POS	PMC5287977.xml	S157	Limitation	POS	Finally, due to the limitations of retrospective studies in general, the authors could not control for all possible confounding factors.
SEMI	POS	PMC5287977.xml	S158	Limitation	POS	As such, it was not possible to conclude that only resident seniority governed the discrepancies in clinical practice observed.
SEMI	POS	PMC5287977.xml	S159	Limitation	POS	Further prospective studies are needed to determine the causality of resident seniority on clinical performance, patient outcomes, and patient and family satisfaction.
SEMI	NEG	PMC5287978.xml	S30	Materials and methods	NEG	There were no age- or gender-based exclusions.
SEMI	NEG	PMC5287978.xml	S44	Materials and methods	NEG	The MELD score was calculated using the web site calculator (http://www.mayoclinic.org/gi-rst/mayomodel7.html).
SEMI	NEG	PMC5287978.xml	S73	Results	NEG	During the follow-up, 16 patients died within 30 days due to upper gastrointestinal bleeding (n = 7), HE (n = 4), or HRS (n = 5).
SEMI	NEG	PMC5287978.xml	S75	Results	NEG	Multivariate logistic regression analysis identified both the MELD score and the CRP level as related to this mortality (Table 3).
SEMI	NEG	PMC5287979.xml	S38	Case presentation	NEG	The serum test for Mycoplasma pneumonia antibody was positive with the titer of 1 :  1280.
SEMI	NEG	PMC5287979.xml	S52	Discussion	NEG	A case–control study revealed that wheezing, chronic rhinosinusitis with postnasal drip, atopy/allergy, and asthma were the most important predisposing factors of recurrent community-acquired pneumonia in children.[6]
SEMI	NEG	PMC5287979.xml	S58	Discussion	NEG	Bronchoscopy revealed surgical sutures twisted with granulation in the left main bronchus.
SEMI	NEG	PMC5287979.xml	S69	Discussion	NEG	Both granulation tissue and inflammation response contributed to such symptoms as cough, hemoptysis, and so on.
SEMI	NEG	PMC5287980.xml	S14		NEG	Breast cancer is the most frequently diagnosed cancer and the leading cause of cancer death among females worldwide, with an estimated 1.7 million incidence and 521,900 mortalities in 2012.[1] Breast cancer alone accounts for 25% of all cancers and 15% of all cancer-related deaths among females.[1]
SEMI	NEG	PMC5287980.xml	S53		NEG	The clinical characteristics and pathological features of all the patients were summarized in Table 1.
SEMI	NEG	PMC5287980.xml	S75		NEG	The number of NLNs and other clinicopathological factors, including race, year of diagnosis, tumor size, grade, ER, PR, were significant risk factors for CSS and OS (Table 3).

SEMI	NEG	PMC5287980.xml	S93		NEG	Interestingly, we found that the patients with the number of >5 NLNs who underwent PMRT had an improved OS and CSS compared with the patients’ non-PMRT (χ2 = 255.00, P < 0.001 for OS; χ2 = 87.04, P < 0.001 for CSS) (Fig. 5A).
SEMI	NEG	PMC5287980.xml	S126		NEG	Although the cutoff point in our study is different from other studies, our results showed that the number of NLNs was an independent prognostic factor of CSS and OS.
SEMI	POS	PMC5287980.xml	S146		POS	This study also has several limitations.
SEMI	POS	PMC5287980.xml	S147		POS	First, some studies have showed that the systemic therapy may bring some substantial survival benefits for PMRT.[18–20]
SEMI	POS	PMC5287980.xml	S148		POS	However, because of the absence of information on chemotherapy or targeted therapy included in the SEER database, its effect on survival could not be evaluated.

SEMI	POS	PMC5287980.xml	S150		POS	Third, the specific dose or methods of radiotherapy was not included in our study, which can affect the survival rate of breast cancer patients.
SEMI	POS	PMC5287980.xml	S151		POS	Therefore, future prospective studies from different countries and regions are needed to further confirm these results.
SEMI	NEG	PMC5287981.xml	S30	Introduction	NEG	Several studies regarding the prevalence of ACS have been conducted.
SEMI	NEG	PMC5287981.xml	S51	Materials and methods	NEG	The common carotid artery (CCA), its bifurcation, and the internal carotid artery (ICA) on each side were examined for the presence of ACS or CP.
SEMI	NEG	PMC5287981.xml	S86	Results	NEG	The frequency of ACS was 4 times higher in males than in females (P < 0.001).
SEMI	NEG	PMC5287981.xml	S95	Discussion	NEG	This difference may stem from the different definitions of ACS used in each study.
SEMI	NEG	PMC5287982.xml	S8	Abstract	NEG	In addition, these factors were markedly different in sPE than in mPE, sGH, or mGH (P ≤ 0.027) and in patients with sGH that in those with mPE or mGH (P < 0.05).
SEMI	NEG	PMC5287982.xml	S18	Introduction	NEG	It has been demonstrated that women who had severe GH (sGH) had increased rates of adverse perinatal outcomes (preterm delivery and small-for-gestational-age [SGA] infants) than in women who had mild GH (mGH) or mild PE (mPE), but similar to those who had severe PE (sPE).[3,4]
SEMI	NEG	PMC5287982.xml	S98	Discussion	NEG	Also of interest was the finding that patients with mPE exhibited patterns of circulating angiogenic factors similar to those patients with mGH.

SEMI	NEG	PMC5287983.xml	S8	Abstract	NEG	DNA sequencing was performed to genotype the CYP3A4∗1G allele in 191 patients.
SEMI	NEG	PMC5287983.xml	S15	Abstract	NEG	Significantly lower amount of sufentanil was consumed in mutant patients compared with wild type subjects, likely a result of impaired CYP3A4 activity due to the point mutation.
SEMI	NEG	PMC5287983.xml	S88	Discussion	NEG	Several studies have shown that CYP3A4∗1G affects the metabolism of fentanyl, another synthetic opioid analgesics.
SEMI	NEG	PMC5287983.xml	S93	Discussion	NEG	Although no significant difference in the age, body weight, or length of surgical procedure was observed between the 2 groups, we found significantly lower amount of sufentanil consumed by mutant patients, likely a result of impaired CYP3A4 activity due to the point mutation.

SEMI	NEG	PMC5291982.xml	S8	Background	NEG	Consecutive patients presenting to a tertiary pleural service between 2008 and 2013 were recruited to a well-established pleural disease study.
SEMI	NEG	PMC5291982.xml	S17	Background	NEG	ROC curve analysis of 425 adult patients with unilateral undiagnosed pleural effusions showed no statistically significant difference in the diagnostic utility of PCT (AUC 0.77), WCC (AUC 0.77) or CRP (AUC 0.85) for the identification of bacterial pleural infection.
SEMI	NEG	PMC5291982.xml	S19	Background	NEG	The diagnostic utility of procalcitonin was not affected by prior antibiotic use (p = 0.80).
SEMI	NEG	PMC5291982.xml	S22	Background	NEG	The study suggests routine procalcitonin testing in all patients with unilateral pleural effusion is not beneficial however further investigation may identify specific patient subsets that may benefit.
SEMI	NEG	PMC5291982.xml	S25	Background	NEG	The trial was approved by the South West Regional Ethics Committee (Ethical approval number 08/H0102/11).
SEMI	NEG	PMC5291982.xml	S32	Background	NEG	Pleural infection may be indicated by symptomatology, classical radiological findings, positive blood culture, raised inflammatory markers, pleural fluid cytology or positive pleural fluid microbiology [1].
SEMI	NEG	PMC5291982.xml	S37	Background	NEG	Procalcitonin has been proposed as a specific systemic marker of bacterial infection which is not affected by viral and other non-bacterial inflammatory states [8].
SEMI	NEG	PMC5291982.xml	S39	Background	NEG	Pleural fluid PCT has been shown to have no clinical use in pleural infection diagnosis or prognosis [6].
SEMI	NEG	PMC5291982.xml	S42	Background	NEG	Whilst procalcitonin is unlikely to remove the requirement for pleural fluid sampling it is yet to be determined whether serum PCT has a role as a first-line investigation in clinical practice.
SEMI	NEG	PMC5291982.xml	S54	Methods	NEG	Clinical details were collected and blood and pleural fluid samples were stored.
SEMI	NEG	PMC5291982.xml	S55	Methods	NEG	Further investigation was performed according to national guidelines [10].
SEMI	NEG	PMC5291982.xml	S60	Methods	NEG	The assay was unable to detect PCT at levels less than 0.05 μg/l.
SEMI	NEG	PMC5291982.xml	S65	Methods	NEG	Thoracic surgery was carried out according to an experienced multi-disciplinary team acting on an individual patient basis.
SEMI	NEG	PMC5291982.xml	S67	Methods	NEG	In case of disagreement a consensus was established through reappraisal of relevant investigations.
SEMI	NEG	PMC5291982.xml	S69	Methods	NEG	Patients were classified into diagnostic categories according to pre-defined criteria (see Additional file 1: Full diagnostic criteria).
SEMI	NEG	PMC5291982.xml	S86	Results	NEG	A definitive diagnosis could not be established for 7 patients (1.4%).
SEMI	NEG	PMC5291982.xml	S89	Results	NEG	The 12-month diagnoses of the 425 patients analysed in the study along with the median PCT, WCC and CRP with interquartile range can be found in Table 2.
SEMI	NEG	PMC5291982.xml	S92	Results	NEG	The main objective of the study was to assess whether PCT had a greater diagnostic utility over WCC and CRP for the identification of pleural infection.
SEMI	NEG	PMC5291982.xml	S93	Results	NEG	Pleural infection was diagnosed in 80/425 patients.
SEMI	NEG	PMC5291982.xml	S95	Results	NEG	32/345 patients without a primary diagnosis of pleural infection had an infection which was not considered to be the primary cause of unilateral pleural effusion.
SEMI	NEG	PMC5291982.xml	S98	Results	NEG	ROC curve analysis showed PCT, WCC and CRP had an area under the curve (AUC) of 0.77 (95% CI = 0.71–0.84), 0.77 (95% CI = 0.71–0.83) and 0.85 (0.80–0.90) respectively for identifying patients with pleural infection (Fig. 2).
SEMI	NEG	PMC5291982.xml	S101	Results	NEG	Two/twenty-four of these patients had a diagnosis of pleural infection.
SEMI	NEG	PMC5291982.xml	S102	Results	NEG	The causes of effusion in the remaining patients were metastatic malignancy (6), congestive cardiac failure (6), renal failure (3), inflammatory pleuritis (2), BAPE (1), hepatic hydrothorax (1), malignant mesothelioma (1) iatrogenic (1) and pleural tuberculosis (1).
SEMI	NEG	PMC5291982.xml	S105	Results	NEG	Eighty patients had a 12-month diagnosis of pleural infection and of these 56 patients had received antibiotics prior to presentation to the pleural service, 17 patients had no prior antibiotics and data was unavailable in 7 cases.
SEMI	NEG	PMC5291982.xml	S106	Results	NEG	The duration of antibiotic use is outlined in Fig. 3.
SEMI	NEG	PMC5291982.xml	S108	Results	NEG	Furthermore there was no significant statistical difference between those who received antibiotics for ≥7 days and those who did not receive antibiotics (p = 0.48).
SEMI	NEG	PMC5291982.xml	S111	Results	NEG	27 patients required no chest drain, 37 patients required a chest drain alone and 16 patients required thoracic surgery.
SEMI	NEG	PMC5291982.xml	S112	Results	NEG	The median and interquartile range of PCT, CRP and WCC for patients who required no chest drain, chest drain alone or thoracic surgery can be found in Fig. 4 as a dot plot.
SEMI	NEG	PMC5291982.xml	S116	Results	NEG	12/80 patients died within 1 year of presentation with pleural infection.
SEMI	NEG	PMC5291982.xml	S124	Results	NEG	WCC and CRP were significantly increased in patients with a co-existing infection.
SEMI	POS	PMC5291982.xml	S169	Discussion	POS	There are limitations to the current study.
SEMI	POS	PMC5291982.xml	S170	Discussion	POS	The study initially investigated the role of PCT in all patients presenting to a pleural service and then focussed on specific subsets of patients.
SEMI	POS	PMC5291982.xml	S171	Discussion	POS	Whilst the current study failed to identify a specific subset where PCT out-performed WCC and CRP there may be subsets not yet analysed who may benefit from serum PCT analysis.
SEMI	POS	PMC5291982.xml	S172	Discussion	POS	Further studies to specifically select patients at presentation who may benefit from PCT measurement could identify a diagnostic role for serum PCT.
SEMI	POS	PMC5291982.xml	S173	Discussion	POS	The analysis was intended to look at the diagnostic capabilities in all patients attending the pleural service however 76/508 patients were excluded because of insufficient storage of sample fluid.
SEMI	POS	PMC5291982.xml	S174	Discussion	POS	There were 7 patients excluded from the trial due to no definitive diagnosis.
SEMI	POS	PMC5291982.xml	S175	Discussion	POS	Further investigation of these patients was not carried out due to clinical resolution of symptoms.
SEMI	POS	PMC5291982.xml	S176	Discussion	POS	The number of patients not consenting to trial inclusion was not recorded.
SEMI	POS	PMC5291982.xml	S177	Discussion	POS	The gold standard for the diagnosis of pleural infection is positive pleural fluid microbiology.
SEMI	POS	PMC5291982.xml	S178	Discussion	POS	In our study 10/80 (12.5%) patients had positive pleural fluid microbiology, this is lower than reported culture positive rates and may be because of the high numbers of patients who had received antibiotics prior to their presentation to our tertiary centre [23, 24].
SEMI	POS	PMC5291982.xml	S179	Discussion	POS	Therefore in order to diagnose infection we relied upon other classical markers such as low pleural fluid pH.
SEMI	POS	PMC5291982.xml	S180	Discussion	POS	Further study of patients with culture-positive pleural infection is required to validate the results.
SEMI	POS	PMC5291982.xml	S181	Discussion	POS	Pleural effusion may also be caused by viral infection [25].
SEMI	POS	PMC5291982.xml	S182	Discussion	POS	Procalcitonin is a poor diagnostic marker of viral infection and therefore may partly explain the current findings.
SEMI	POS	PMC5291982.xml	S183	Discussion	POS	The study was conducted at a single centre, and the results may not be representative of patient subgroups in other healthcare settings, particularly with respect to decision-making around invasive procedures and surgery specifically, the thresholds for which may vary internationally.
SEMI	POS	PMC5291982.xml	S184	Discussion	POS	In our study PCT was only measured at one time point (at initial presentation).
SEMI	POS	PMC5291982.xml	S185	Discussion	POS	Previous studies in non-pleural disease have used procalcitonin as a biomarker to decide when to stop antibiotic therapy [17, 18].
SEMI	POS	PMC5291982.xml	S186	Discussion	POS	The role of PCT in monitoring response to treatment was not assessed by the current study.
SEMI	POS	PMC5291982.xml	S187	Discussion	POS	The measurement of serum PCT was performed on frozen stored samples of serum.
SEMI	POS	PMC5291982.xml	S188	Discussion	POS	We were unable to guarantee the samples had not been altered through the storage process.
SEMI	POS	PMC5291982.xml	S189	Discussion	POS	The study design meant that the investigators and clinicians were not blinded to CRP or WCC during treatment and diagnosis and these values may have influenced decisions on management and specifically thoracic surgery.
SEMI	POS	PMC5291982.xml	S190	Discussion	POS	Furthermore, the CRP and WCC may have influenced the definitive consultant diagnosis thus overestimating the diagnostic accuracy of CRP and WCC.
SEMI	POS	PMC5291982.xml	S191	Discussion	POS	The PCT value, however, was not available during investigation, treatment or diagnosis.
SEMI	POS	PMC5291982.xml	S192	Discussion	POS	Procalcitonin has previously been used as a marker of systemic infection [8].
SEMI	POS	PMC5291982.xml	S193	Discussion	POS	The intention of the study was to assess the diagnostic utility of PCT in pleural infection rather than its use as a marker of systemic infection.
SEMI	POS	PMC5291982.xml	S194	Discussion	POS	It is possible that PCT failed to outperform traditional biomarkers because compartmentalised pleural infection has a reduced effect on serum PCT.
SEMI	POS	PMC5291982.xml	S195	Discussion	POS	To prevent analysis of patients with raised PCT due to non-pleural infection we excluded patients with infections that were not the primary cause of the unilateral pleural effusion from our analysis.
SEMI	POS	PMC5291982.xml	S196	Discussion	POS	However in practice the location of infection may not always be apparent at presentation and as such further targeted investigations are always required.
SEMI	POS	PMC5291982.xml	S197	Discussion	POS	Our study attempted to analyse the effect of the prior use of antibiotics on the diagnostic capabilities of PCT.
SEMI	POS	PMC5291982.xml	S198	Discussion	POS	The study was limited as just 17 patients received no antibiotics prior to presentation.
SEMI	POS	PMC5291982.xml	S199	Discussion	POS	It is likely that PCT responds to antibiotics in 24–48 h and therefore further analysis should be carried out on patients who had received <48 h of antibiotics.
SEMI	POS	PMC5291982.xml	S200	Discussion	POS	The current dataset would have to be extended to confirm the relationship between antibiotic use and serum PCT.
SEMI	NEG	PMC5291982.xml	S203	Conclusions	NEG	No additional diagnostic utility was found when using procalcitonin over CRP and WCC in identifying bacterial pleural infection.
SEMI	NEG	PMC5292241.xml	S10		NEG	The terminology is intended to mature with use, user feedback, and optimization.
SEMI	NEG	PMC5293410.xml	S62	Experimental	NEG	The product was washed 4 or 5 times with distilled water, dried in vacuum at 70°C, and identified as carboxylated MWCNTs.
SEMI	NEG	PMC5293410.xml	S114	Results and discussion	NEG	The emission peak of ClCQDs located at about 452 nm with multicenters, indicating relative complicate distribution.
SEMI	NEG	PMC5293410.xml	S122	Results and discussion	NEG	And thus the Desmin concentrations in unknown serum samples could be determined by the same probe after standardization.
SEMI	NEG	PMC5293410.xml	S126	Results and discussion	NEG	The R-square value gradually decreased from 0.994 to 0.916 when the Desmin concentration in PBS/serum samples reduced from 15 to 1 ng/mL.
SEMI	NEG	PMC5293411.xml	S6	Abstract	NEG	Our research was conducted to examine the association between 3 single-nucleotide polymorphisms in the CDH1 gene and NSCL/P.
SEMI	NEG	PMC5293411.xml	S8	Abstract	NEG	Three single-nucleotide polymorphisms (rs16260, rs9929218, and rs1801552) of the CDH1 gene were genotyped using the Snapshot mini-sequencing technique in 331 patients with NSCL/P and 271 controls from the northern Chinese Han population.
SEMI	NEG	PMC5293411.xml	S37	Material and methods	NEG	They were patients at the Affiliated Stomatology Hospital of Harbin Medical University, the Second Affiliated Hospital of Harbin Medical University, Harbin Children's Hospital, and Heilongjiang Provincial Hospital.
SEMI	NEG	PMC5293411.xml	S98	Discussion	NEG	The results indicated that the presence of the CDH1 rs1801552 TT genotype under the assumption of a recessive model is related to the decreased risk for NSCL/P in the northern Chinese Han population.
SEMI	NEG	PMC5293413.xml	S43	Methods	NEG	Magnetic resonance imaging consisting of axial T2-weighted, DWI, and gradient echo T2-weighted images was performed within 1 day of admission.
SEMI	NEG	PMC5293413.xml	S77	Methods	NEG	To classify the stroke etiology, we categorized all cases into 3 groups: cardioembolism (CE), large-artery atherosclerosis, and combined.[23]
SEMI	NEG	PMC5293413.xml	S80	Methods	NEG	Differences between groups were analyzed using analysis of variance and the chi-squared test, for continuous and categorical variables.
SEMI	NEG	PMC5293413.xml	S97	Results	NEG	Occlusion sites on DSA were as follows: cervical occlusion (n = 17, 35%), cavernous occlusion (n = 22, 45%), and terminus occlusion (n = 10, 20%).
SEMI	NEG	PMC5293413.xml	S109	Results	NEG	Carotid occlusive patterns were significantly different (P < 0.001): the stump (82.4%) was the most common pattern in cervical occlusion, the spearhead (68.2%) was the most common in cavernous occlusion, and streak pattern (60.0%) was the most prominent in terminus occlusion.
SEMI	NEG	PMC5293413.xml	S133	Discussion	NEG	Our study shows that the clinical variability in ICA occlusions is significantly associated with the DSA-confirmed ICA occlusion site.
SEMI	NEG	PMC5293413.xml	S155	Discussion	NEG	In this study, a rounded-stump pattern of the carotid represented an occlusion in the cervical portion of the ICA (60.9%).
SEMI	NEG	PMC5293413.xml	S158	Discussion	NEG	Compared to other occlusion sites (3%), our study showed that there was a higher presence of vascular calcification (53%) in cervical ICA occlusions.
SEMI	POS	PMC5293413.xml	S162	Discussion	POS	We acknowledge some limitations in this study.
SEMI	POS	PMC5293413.xml	S163	Discussion	POS	First, it is comprised of relatively small sample size and is subject to the biases of a single center observational study.
SEMI	POS	PMC5293413.xml	S164	Discussion	POS	However, we tried to overcome this limitation by including patients in a given period of time who received coherent IV and/or endovascular thrombolysis.
SEMI	POS	PMC5293413.xml	S165	Discussion	POS	Our observation is also somewhat hypothetical because we addressed the anatomical properties and morphological features according to ICA occlusion sites.
SEMI	POS	PMC5293413.xml	S166	Discussion	POS	Moreover, our results should be cautiously interpreted because IV-tPA administration after the initial CTA may have changed the location of ICA occlusion sites that were confirmed on subsequent DSA.
SEMI	POS	PMC5293413.xml	S167	Discussion	POS	However, the low rates of recanalization with IV-tPA in acute carotid occlusion make this less of an issue.
SEMI	POS	PMC5293413.xml	S168	Discussion	POS	Finally, our outcome results should be carefully interpreted because our study did not include acute ICA patients who underwent currently available thrombus retrieval technology.
SEMI	POS	PMC5293413.xml	S169	Discussion	POS	Therefore, more detailed studies concerning the aftermath of this new technology are warranted.
SEMI	NEG	PMC5293414.xml	S25	Introduction	NEG	To overcome such a problem, a multicenter case study has been conducted in 15 university hospitals in Korea.[13]
SEMI	NEG	PMC5293414.xml	S29	Introduction	NEG	For precise epidemiologic data, a longitudinal study based on a large standardized population is required, but these studies are costly as well as difficult to perform.
SEMI	NEG	PMC5293414.xml	S38	Methods	NEG	The NHI program covered 49,989,620 beneficiaries in 2013, which represents 97.9% of the population in the Republic of Korea.
SEMI	NEG	PMC5293414.xml	S39	Methods	NEG	All billing claims are submitted by health service providers to the Health Insurance Review & Assessment Service (HIRA), a government-affiliated agency, using the diagnostic and procedure codes of the International Classification of Diseases-10.[14] HIRA provides open access to the recent nationwide data of NHI claims, which includes the annual number of inpatients and outpatients with specific disease codes (access at http://opendata.hira.or.kr/op/opc/olap3thDsInfo.do).
SEMI	NEG	PMC5293414.xml	S64	Results	NEG	Since the interaction term with gender and year did not showed statistical significance (OR = 1.00; 95% CI, 0.993–1.008; P = 0.89), 3 main effects (year, gender, and age group) and 2 interactions (“year and age group” and “gender and age group”) were included in the final model.
SEMI	NEG	PMC5293414.xml	S67	Results	NEG	The year-age group interaction in the 0 to 19 age group was significantly stronger than in other age groups (Table 2).
SEMI	NEG	PMC5293414.xml	S78	Discussion	NEG	There was also a 5-fold increase in anaphylaxis admissions among patients younger than 20 years in New York, United States, from 1 to 4.6 per 100,000 person-years between 1990 and 2006.[16] The anaphylaxis admission rates in Australia more than doubled from 3.6 to 8.0 per 100,000 person-years between 1994 and 2005 and such change occurred across all age groups.[10]
SEMI	NEG	PMC5293414.xml	S96	Discussion	NEG	However, we could not define the specific causes of anaphylaxis in this study because most of the cases were coded as unspecified anaphylaxis.
SEMI	POS	PMC5293414.xml	S97	Discussion	POS	This study has several limitations.
SEMI	POS	PMC5293414.xml	S98	Discussion	POS	In the results of the multicenter case study from Korea, drug (46.5%) and food (24.2%) induced anaphylaxis were the most frequent followed by insect stings (16.4%), exercise (5.9%), and unknown etiology (7.0%).[13]
SEMI	POS	PMC5293414.xml	S99	Discussion	POS	However, we could not evaluate the incidence of each subtype of the anaphylaxis in this study since most of the anaphylaxis cases were coded as classified as T78.2 (unspecified).
SEMI	POS	PMC5293414.xml	S100	Discussion	POS	Especially insect sting was reported as one of the major causes of anaphylaxis in previous reports of United States but insect sting-related anaphylaxis was unable to extract because of unavailability of compatible ICD code.
SEMI	POS	PMC5293414.xml	S101	Discussion	POS	The inability to include insect sting anaphylaxis is a common problem with studies using ICD-10 codes to detect anaphylaxis.
SEMI	POS	PMC5293414.xml	S102	Discussion	POS	There may be a problem with the accuracy of diagnostic coding.
SEMI	POS	PMC5293414.xml	S103	Discussion	POS	In some instances, alternative diagnostic codes such as acute urticaria, angioedema, and asthma attack might be used in real-life practice rather than anaphylaxis.
SEMI	POS	PMC5293414.xml	S104	Discussion	POS	To overcome such problem, using an appropriate operational definition (e.g., combining epinephrine prescription data) to detect anaphylaxis cases would be needed.
SEMI	NEG	PMC5293415.xml	S19		NEG	However, there has been a trend towards performing procedures as an outpatient as permitted by advancements in anesthetic and surgical techniques.[2]
SEMI	NEG	PMC5293415.xml	S20		NEG	In 2013, the American Thyroid Association (ATA) 2013 position paper established that “outpatient thyroidectomy may be undertaken safely in a carefully selected patient population provided that precautionary measures are taken.”[3] As there are no consensus selection criteria for outpatient thyroid surgery, patients are considered for outpatient thyroidectomy if they have social support, access to care and communication, and have no prohibitive medical conditions.[4]
SEMI	NEG	PMC5293415.xml	S34		NEG	It is a comprehensive surgical database and quality improvement program which collects data and provides risk-adjusted outcomes.
SEMI	NEG	PMC5293415.xml	S36		NEG	Demographic, preoperative, intraoperative, and 30-day postoperative data are collected.
SEMI	NEG	PMC5293416.xml	S11	Abstract	NEG	These data demonstrated that TERT promoter mutation is a frequent event in HCC; however, telomere length, but not the presence of a TERT promoter mutation, might have potential value as a prognostic indicator of HCC.
SEMI	NEG	PMC5293416.xml	S74	Results	NEG	The presence of the TERT promoter mutation could not be performed on 2 HCC samples.
SEMI	NEG	PMC5293416.xml	S78	Results	NEG	A TERT promoter mutation was statistically associated with males (P = 0.027).
SEMI	NEG	PMC5293416.xml	S120	Discussion	NEG	Our results also showed a positive association of TERT promoter mutations with HCV, but not with HBV, with a higher frequency in males.
SEMI	NEG	PMC5293417.xml	S34	Case report	NEG	Magnetic resonance cholangiopancreatography (MRCP) revealed a mass in the ampulla of the duodenum, and dilation of intrahepatic and extrahepatic biliary ducts and pancreatic ducts (Fig. 1A).
SEMI	NEG	PMC5293417.xml	S55	Discussion	NEG	The number of living patients with liver transplant has increased over the recent years given improvement in survival and emergence of gastrointestinal tumors has been reported recently.[10,11]
SEMI	NEG	PMC5293417.xml	S65	Discussion	NEG	Radiofrequency ablation can remove tumor tissues and achieve reduction in tumor volume in patients with inoperable biliary tract cancer, with demonstrable survival benefit.[5]
SEMI	NEG	PMC5293417.xml	S75	Discussion	NEG	No bile duct fistula as a result of radiofrequency ablation has been reported so far and our patient also did not develop bile duct fistula.

SEMI	NEG	PMC5293418.xml	S156	Discussion	NEG	In the context of renal involvement of diabetes, we observed higher ACR but lower eGFR in our coronary patients, and we adjusted for eGFR and ACR with respect to the association between diabetes and uromodulin.
SEMI	NEG	PMC5293418.xml	S160	Discussion	NEG	In that context, the role of tubular injury and excretion of tubular proteins in early stages of diabetic nephropathy have been repeatedly emphasized.[37–44]
SEMI	NEG	PMC5293420.xml	S4	Abstract	NEG	We studied intermediate uveitis patients using ocular and systemic evaluations and a Toxocara IgG serology test.
SEMI	NEG	PMC5293420.xml	S7	Abstract	NEG	Thirteen patients had a history of eating raw cow liver.
SEMI	NEG	PMC5293420.xml	S32	Methods	NEG	Inclusion criteria included patients diagnosed with naive intermediate uveitis without retinal lesion and no known related disease until the first visit, with a follow-up of at least 6 months after the first diagnosis and treatment.
SEMI	NEG	PMC5293420.xml	S42	Methods	NEG	It was also used to compare the number of higher IgE levels (>100 IU/mL), and eosinophilia (eosinophil counts > 500/μL or > 5.0% of the total white blood cell count) in the recurrent and nonrecurrent OT groups.[10,13,20]
SEMI	NEG	PMC5293420.xml	S53	Results	NEG	Of the 19 OT patients, 12 (63.16%) had higher IgE values than the normal range (>100 IU/mL) and only 4 (21.05%) had eosinophilia.
SEMI	NEG	PMC5293420.xml	S84	Discussion	NEG	However, of 14 male OT patients, 11 had a history of eating raw cow liver, and we could not find an obvious route of infection in only 2 patients.
SEMI	NEG	PMC5293420.xml	S85	Discussion	NEG	This infection route also influences the age of onset of OT in the Korean population.
SEMI	NEG	PMC5293420.xml	S89	Discussion	NEG	In the analyses of intermediate uveitis patients with or without OT, the presence of bilateral ocular involvement was significantly different between the 2 groups.

SEMI	POS	PMC5293420.xml	S106	Discussion	POS	The sample size was small and the follow-up period was relatively short, so we plan to analyze additional cases over time and analyze them again several years later.
SEMI	POS	PMC5293420.xml	S107	Discussion	POS	In addition, there may have been selection bias involving the location of the study population, because our hospital was located in an urban area (Suwon, Republic of Korea).
SEMI	POS	PMC5293420.xml	S108	Discussion	POS	A previous study reported that there is a difference in prevalence by location of residence,[10] but we did not survey this parameter.
SEMI	POS	PMC5293420.xml	S109	Discussion	POS	The ages of most patients (73.68%) were >50 years, and most patients experienced a change in location from rural to urban areas, but we did not take this change into account in our analyses.
SEMI	POS	PMC5293420.xml	S110	Discussion	POS	However, an accurate record of changes in living location may be helpful for tracing the infection route of OT.
SEMI	POS	PMC5293420.xml	S111	Discussion	POS	We also did not record data on ingestion of raw cow liver and meats, or ownership of pets in non-OT patients.
SEMI	POS	PMC5293420.xml	S112	Discussion	POS	In addition, although other studies used the aqueous humor or vitreous humor as samples for testing, or the Western blot technique for diagnoses,[22,27,28] we detected IgG antibodies to Toxocara using only an indirect ELISA assay based on the Toxocara larva antigen in blood samples.[17,18]
SEMI	POS	PMC5293420.xml	S113	Discussion	POS	Analyses using additional samples or methods could have helped confirm our results.
SEMI	NEG	PMC5293420.xml	S115	Discussion	NEG	In cases of intermediate uveitis, the possibility of OT should be considered, and knowledge of eating history and toxocariasis serological tests should be performed.

SEMI	POS	PMC5293421.xml	S150	Discussion	POS	This study has some limitations.
SEMI	POS	PMC5293421.xml	S151	Discussion	POS	It included only children with voluntary poisoning admitted in a tertiary hospital from the northeast part of Romania; mild poisoning cases who did not need hospital care were excluded, as well as patients without a psychological and psychiatric examination.
SEMI	POS	PMC5293421.xml	S152	Discussion	POS	Due to these limitations, we cannot estimate a rate of adolescent poisoning and the presented result are not representative of all self-inflicted poisoning cases among adolescents in Romania.
SEMI	POS	PMC5293421.xml	S153	Discussion	POS	The incidence of alcohol and ethnobotanic substances intoxication is higher in general population, if we consider also the less dramatic cases, but without differences in terms of gender or demographic distribution from severe cases.

SEMI	NEG	PMC5293424.xml	S71	Results	NEG	The most commonly registered preoperative diagnosis, in order of decreasing frequency, were regraft (40.5%), aphakic bullous keratoplasty or pseudophakic bullous keratoplasty (23.8%), and traumatic or postinfectious corneal scarring (23.8%).
SEMI	NEG	PMC5293424.xml	S83	Results	NEG	The characteristics of the lesions are categorized according to the location and size, which are summarized in Table 4.
SEMI	NEG	PMC5293424.xml	S116	Discussion	NEG	In the current study, the incidence declined and the leading indications shifted to regraft (40.5%), aphakic bullous keratoplasty or pseudophakic bullous keratopathy (23.8%), and traumatic corneal scarring (14.3%).[7]
SEMI	NEG	PMC5293424.xml	S155	Discussion	NEG	Several complications were recorded in our study and, of which, graft failure outweighed all the rest complications (71.4%).

SEMI	NEG	PMC5293425.xml	S75	Material and methods	NEG	The diagnosis of cerebrovascular events was based on the American Heart Association/American Stroke Association recommendations.[12–13]
SEMI	NEG	PMC5293425.xml	S78	Material and methods	NEG	Statistical analysis was performed using SPSS software, version 20.0 (SPSS Inc, Chicago, IL).
SEMI	NEG	PMC5293425.xml	S111	Discussion	NEG	Our main finding was that a lower eGFR was an independent predictor of newly ischemic events in ischemic stroke patients with ICAS in further analysis.
SEMI	NEG	PMC5293425.xml	S115	Discussion	NEG	Various outcomes had been presented in researches concerning CKD phases and the prognosis of ischemic stroke.[6,24–27]
SEMI	NEG	PMC5293425.xml	S123	Discussion	NEG	So it was possible that these patients did not suffer from a severe neurological impairment and non-neurological organ dysfunction.
SEMI	NEG	PMC5293425.xml	S125	Discussion	NEG	Thus, the progression of endothelial dysfunction and following atherosclerosis was probably one of the mechanisms for stroke in patients with reduced eGFR.
SEMI	NEG	PMC5293425.xml	S136	Discussion	NEG	They also shared similar dynamic changes because of susceptibilities to vascular damage.[36–37]
SEMI	POS	PMC5293425.xml	S138	Discussion	POS	Our research has several limitations.
SEMI	POS	PMC5293425.xml	S139	Discussion	POS	First, this study was an observational study, not a randomized controlled trial.
SEMI	POS	PMC5293425.xml	S140	Discussion	POS	Secondly, the sample size was small, especially when we made a further analysis in ICAS and ECAS patients, only collecting ischemic stroke patients from one hospital.
SEMI	POS	PMC5293425.xml	S141	Discussion	POS	Thirdly, we only made a short-term follow-up for 3 months.
SEMI	POS	PMC5293425.xml	S142	Discussion	POS	A long-term observation may give more information concerning the effect of the kidney dysfunction on cerebrovascular disease.
SEMI	POS	PMC5293425.xml	S143	Discussion	POS	In addition, we just evaluated kidney function with Modification of Diet in Renal Disease formula.
SEMI	POS	PMC5293425.xml	S144	Discussion	POS	Although it is generally accepted as a valid surrogate of kidney function, additional measurement of albuminuria (albumin to creatinine ratio) and cystatin-C may improve our assessment of CKD.
SEMI	POS	PMC5293425.xml	S145	Discussion	POS	In further analysis, more acute ischemic stroke patients, including ICAS, ECAS, and both, would be included to analyze the predictive ability of CKD for acute ischemic stroke.
SEMI	NEG	PMC5293426.xml	S96	Results	NEG	Forty-four (17%) of the patients died: 8 before initiation of treatment and 36 during treatment.
SEMI	NEG	PMC5293426.xml	S136	Discussion	NEG	Previous studies reported an underlying disorder making the host vulnerable to miliary TB (HIV infection, collagen-vascular disorder, diabetes mellitus, neoplasm, chronic renal failure, pregnancy, steroid use, and alcoholism) in nearly half (30%–66%) of the cases.[4,12,13,23,26]
SEMI	NEG	PMC5293426.xml	S163	Discussion	NEG	Routine mycobacterial blood culture and/or bone marrow culture is recommended during evaluations for mycobacterial infections in miliary TB patients.

SEMI	NEG	PMC5293426.xml	S179	Discussion	NEG	Although liver function tests were normal and hepatomegaly was not present in nearly one-third of the cases, liver biopsy showed granulomas in all of 21 patients experienced this procedure.
SEMI	NEG	PMC5293426.xml	S201	Discussion	NEG	The mortality rate is ∼25% (14%–30%), and seemed to remain unchanged during last 25 years.[3,4,8,9,12,14,23–25]
SEMI	POS	PMC5293426.xml	S206	Discussion	POS	Our study has several limitations.
SEMI	POS	PMC5293426.xml	S207	Discussion	POS	The main limitation of our study is its retrospective design; however, miliary TB is very rare presentation of TB even in highly endemic countries.
SEMI	POS	PMC5293426.xml	S208	Discussion	POS	Therefore, it is time consuming and difficult to perform a prospective cohort study.
SEMI	POS	PMC5293426.xml	S209	Discussion	POS	Second limitation is that information on variables may potentially be incomplete as this was a retrospective chart review; however, statistical adjustment (data completion) could be done with appropriate techniques by competent statistician.
SEMI	POS	PMC5293426.xml	S210	Discussion	POS	Third limitation is the low rate of positive blood cultures.
SEMI	POS	PMC5293426.xml	S211	Discussion	POS	It is expected to have higher rates of mycobacterial growth in cultures obtained using procedures that are up to the standards.
SEMI	NEG	PMC5293427.xml	S30		NEG	The following information was collected and abstracted by physicians in the participating departments: demographics, medical history and chronic medication, physical examination findings, laboratory data, New York Heart Association (NYHA) functional classification prior to the acute event, HF etiology and suspected precipitating factors of current event, electrocardiogram, chest radiography, in-hospital management and events and hospitalization outcome.
SEMI	NEG	PMC5293427.xml	S35		NEG	Thus, a total of 3393 patients were included in the present analysis.
SEMI	NEG	PMC5293427.xml	S82		NEG	The statistical software used was SPSS version 20 (IBM Inc, New York).
SEMI	NEG	PMC5293427.xml	S97		NEG	Blood pressure lowering medications prescribed at discharge did not differ significantly between the groups (Table 2).

SEMI	NEG	PMC5293427.xml	S114		NEG	The upper quartile SBP change was similarly associated with greater mortality risk, more pronounced in the HFpSF group (HR 1.25; 1.01–1.54 and HR 1.18; CI 1.07–1.30, respectively).
SEMI	NEG	PMC5293427.xml	S124		NEG	Consistent results were obtained when we compared patients with admission SBP ≥120 mm Hg to those with SBP <120 mm Hg.
SEMI	POS	PMC5293427.xml	S155		POS	Our study has a number of important limitations.

SEMI	POS	PMC5293427.xml	S157		POS	The HFSIS registry has no data regarding postdischarge treatment or clinical events other than all-cause mortality.
SEMI	POS	PMC5293427.xml	S158		POS	Also, we do not have detailed information regarding in-hospital medication doses and cannot adjust for dose changes.
SEMI	POS	PMC5293427.xml	S159		POS	We could only include adjustment for medication changes on admission and discharge.
SEMI	POS	PMC5293427.xml	S160		POS	The main outcome was defined as all-cause mortality, as data regarding the cause of death, including cardiovascular mortality or adverse events, was not available.
SEMI	POS	PMC5293427.xml	S161		POS	Finally, the exact time of blood pressure measurements was not recorded in the HFSIS registry and therefore could not be adjusted for.

SEMI	NEG	PMC5293430.xml	S27	Introduction	NEG	The aims of this study were to present the demographic characteristics of patients with refractory GERD symptoms in China and to analyze the data obtained from questionnaires, HRM, and ambulatory impedance-pH monitoring.
SEMI	NEG	PMC5293430.xml	S89	Results	NEG	However, basal LES pressure, LESPI, DCI, and basal UES pressure in the RE and NERD groups were lower than in the HE and FH groups (all P < 0.05).
SEMI	NEG	PMC5293430.xml	S102	Results	NEG	Acid exposure time in the RE and NERD groups was higher than in the HE and FH groups in 3 varied situations (all P < 0.05) (Table 3).
SEMI	NEG	PMC5293430.xml	S132	Discussion	NEG	The different patterns of reflux among these patients with refractory symptoms are due to unidentified mechanisms that must be elucidated through continued research, especially if this may help clinicians to better control their patients’ symptoms.
SEMI	NEG	PMC5293431.xml	S4	Abstract	NEG	Patients with PAD have an increased rate of mortality due to concurrent coronary artery disease and hypertension.
SEMI	NEG	PMC5293431.xml	S20	Abstract	NEG	Patients hospitalized for PAD with a BB in their prescription did not worsen their outcome at 1 year compared to patients without BB.
SEMI	NEG	PMC5293431.xml	S38	Introduction	NEG	Radack et al concluded that BB could probably be used safely in PAD patients,[15] whereas meta-analysis from Miyajima et al showed that there was a significant worsening in maximal walking distance and initial claudication distance in patients receiving BB.[16]
SEMI	NEG	PMC5293431.xml	S40	Introduction	NEG	However, the authors recommend that BB should be used with caution, in the case of CLI for which acute lowering of blood pressure is contraindicated.
SEMI	NEG	PMC5293431.xml	S42	Introduction	NEG	In this context, we carried out a study, aimed at assessing BB prescription in patients hospitalized for PAD from the COPART Registry and analyzing their impact on 1-year morbidity and mortality.
SEMI	NEG	PMC5293431.xml	S63	Methods	NEG	The primary outcome for this study was the overall mortality during the 1-year follow-up.
SEMI	NEG	PMC5293431.xml	S83	Results	NEG	In multivariate analysis, history of hypertension or prior myocardial infarction were independent factors for BB prescription with OR (95% CI) of 2.60 (1.75–3.86), P < 0.001 and 3.02 (2.15–4.25), P < 0.001, respectively.
SEMI	NEG	PMC5293431.xml	S109	Discussion	NEG	Indeed, neither overall mortality, nor cardiovascular mortality, or amputation rates were impacted by the presence of BB in the prescription list.
SEMI	NEG	PMC5293431.xml	S119	Discussion	NEG	As a reminder, without contraindication, BB are recommended for patients with a chronic heart failure and left ventricular ejection function (LVEF) <40%,[29] or a history of acute coronary syndrome without persistent ST-segment elevation and LVEF < 40%.[31]
SEMI	NEG	PMC5293431.xml	S126	Discussion	NEG	These cohorts reported between 286 and 8273 PAD patients based on ABI < 0.9 or history of amputation or peripheral revascularization.
SEMI	POS	PMC5293431.xml	S136	Discussion	POS	Our study has some limitations.
SEMI	POS	PMC5293431.xml	S137	Discussion	POS	This is an observational study, not a randomized trial.
SEMI	POS	PMC5293431.xml	S138	Discussion	POS	Findings should, therefore, be addressed with usual caution, although we made multivariate analysis to take into account factors affecting BB prescription.
SEMI	POS	PMC5293431.xml	S139	Discussion	POS	Details on what BB and what dosage are not provided in our study.
SEMI	POS	PMC5293431.xml	S140	Discussion	POS	We are aware that BB have different pharmacokinetic and pharmacodynamic properties, which introduce heterogeneity in the analysis.

SEMI	POS	PMC5293431.xml	S142	Discussion	POS	Moreover, we used patient's prescription list as a proxy for actual drug use, but we had no information regarding patient's compliance to treatment.
SEMI	POS	PMC5293431.xml	S143	Discussion	POS	While our registry is one of the largest ones for patients hospitalized for PAD, we were unable to perform subgroup analyses because of statistical power weakening in smaller groups.
SEMI	POS	PMC5293431.xml	S144	Discussion	POS	However, we are confident regarding exhaustiveness in the follow-up of death and amputation.
SEMI	POS	PMC5293431.xml	S145	Discussion	POS	Not only because the death criteria were easily retrieved, and the amputations were done in the participating hospitals, but also because the accuracy of the data sources in the COPART Registry was previously described as good.[18,43,44]
SEMI	NEG	PMC5293432.xml	S3	Abstract	NEG	It remains unclear whether statin therapy should be applied to ischemic stroke patients with atrial fibrillation.
SEMI	NEG	PMC5293432.xml	S97	Discussion	NEG	It was not unreasonable that the annual recurrent stroke risk in this study was higher than patients receiving apixaben in a randomized controlled trial.
SEMI	NEG	PMC5293432.xml	S123	Discussion	NEG	Therefore, out-of-hospital mortality was not captured.
SEMI	NEG	PMC5293432.xml	S127	Discussion	NEG	However, statin use was associated with a decreased risk of in-hospital death during follow-up period.
SEMI	NEG	PMC5293433.xml	S58	Methods	NEG	It was defined by the presence of H pylori on histological examination of gastric biopsies and a positive rapid urease test or a[13] C-urea breath test (UBT), according to previously reported methods.[14]
SEMI	NEG	PMC5293433.xml	S86	Results	NEG	The prevalence of CD was significantly higher among women (4.7% vs 2.1%; P < 0.0001).
SEMI	NEG	PMC5293433.xml	S129	Discussion	NEG	In a large screening cohort including 7,603 subjects undergoing a baseline and follow-up EGD and tested for H pylori, a positive association between the infection and hyperplastic polyps (OR 2.01; 95% CI 1.66–2.41) was found.[19]
SEMI	NEG	PMC5293433.xml	S134	Discussion	NEG	In our series, the inverse effect of H pylori was prevalent in patients with an active gastritis compared to patients with gastritis associated with metaplasia and/or atrophy.
SEMI	NEG	PMC5293434.xml	S25		NEG	In contrast, clinical trials conducted in the general population have consistently demonstrated the efficacy of renin–angiotensin system blocking drugs on reducing cardiovascular outcomes.[20–23]

SEMI	NEG	PMC5293435.xml	S37		NEG	Serum IL-6 and IL-8 level were normally log distributed within both groups; hence, values were transformed to the natural logarithm (Ln).
SEMI	NEG	PMC5293435.xml	S58		NEG	According to the progression pattern, 42 (79.2%) patients were included in the limited group and 11 (20.8%) patients in the progressed group.
SEMI	NEG	PMC5293435.xml	S62		NEG	According to the progression pattern, the initial disease status was shown in Supplementary Fig. 2.
SEMI	NEG	PMC5293435.xml	S78		NEG	Analysis of the overall survival by univariate Cox regression analysis showed higher age, poor ECOG performance status, high CA19-9, higher longest dimension of the primary tumor, and initially locally advanced or metastatic cancer were significantly associated with shorter survival (Table 3).
SEMI	NEG	PMC5293435.xml	S89		NEG	This study revealed that IL-6 is correlated with inflammatory markers such as CRP and NLR, and that it was an independent risk factor for progression to extensive hepatic metastasis.

SEMI	POS	PMC5293435.xml	S103		POS	First, it is retrospective design.
SEMI	POS	PMC5293435.xml	S104		POS	Second, the tumor progression pattern was assessed by the abdomen computed tomography not autopsy, and by using measurable lesion of the hepatic metastatic burden except for nonmeasurable lesion such as peritoneal seeding, lymphatic pulmonary metastasis, and bone destructive metastasis.
SEMI	POS	PMC5293435.xml	S105		POS	To the best of our knowledge, we investigate of the relationship between proinflammatory cytokines and tumor progression pattern for the first time.
SEMI	POS	PMC5293435.xml	S106		POS	In conclusion, higher serum IL-6 was an independent risk factor for progression to extensive hepatic metastasis of PDAC, even though it did not correlate with survival.
SEMI	POS	PMC5293435.xml	S107		POS	Therefore, more aggressive chemotherapy from the beginning should be considered in PDAC patients with high IL-6.

SEMI	NEG	PMC5293438.xml	S39	Introduction	NEG	Nonetheless, the detailed mechanisms of the effects of B. javanica on neoplasms, especially those of the brain, have never been explored.
SEMI	NEG	PMC5293438.xml	S69	Case report	NEG	His orientation, registration, attention, calculation, recall, language, and praxis were markedly reduced.
SEMI	NEG	PMC5293438.xml	S120	Discussion	NEG	First, we should emphasize a combination of tonification and purgation as well as a treatment regime for improving the body's resistance to eliminate pathogenic factors.
SEMI	NEG	PMC5293438.xml	S136	Discussion	NEG	For example, a scorpion has been used in TCM to treat chronic neurological disorders, such as neuropathic pain, paralysis and epilepsy, for thousands of years.
SEMI	NEG	PMC5293439.xml	S44	Discussion	NEG	Mitral lateral Em on behalf of diastolic function in our case was 11 cm/s, a little faster than that in restrictive cardiomyopathy (lower than 6–8 cm/s).

SEMI	NEG	PMC5293439.xml	S52	Discussion	NEG	Only 1 report that radiation-induced myocardial fibrosis observed by LGE-MRI has been published.[6]
SEMI	NEG	PMC5293439.xml	S54	Discussion	NEG	Thus, it was of importance to perform LGE-MRI to understand the myocardium damage and confirm the diagnosis of cadiomyopathy due to radiation, which probably taking place of endomyocardial biopsy.
SEMI	NEG	PMC5293440.xml	S15	Introduction	NEG	Teaching management of medical emergencies to medical students and residents alike should consist of improving factual knowledge, and also practical skills such as quick patient assessment, manual skills, and overall care.
SEMI	NEG	PMC5293440.xml	S16	Introduction	NEG	Many techniques can be taught on simulators, including airway management and endotracheal intubation,[1,2] cardiopulmonary resuscitation,[3] or vascular access.
SEMI	NEG	PMC5293440.xml	S18	Introduction	NEG	Accordingly, standardized patients, sometimes referred to as simulated patients, are increasingly used in the education of students and residents,[11–15] and, albeit very costly compared with traditional seminars, this may improve trainee communication skills[7–10] and teaching in various medical fields.[16–17]
SEMI	NEG	PMC5293440.xml	S19	Introduction	NEG	However, the effect on clinical performance when using standardized patients has not been studied to a great extent, mostly using observational studies or self-report satisfaction questionnaires.[5]
SEMI	NEG	PMC5293440.xml	S21	Introduction	NEG	With tightening budgets of medical schools and limited physician time, money should only be spent on teaching techniques that have proven to be effective.
SEMI	NEG	PMC5293440.xml	S23	Introduction	NEG	Two outcomes were analyzed:(1)Performance in a written multiple choice test to assess factual knowledge(2)Performance in an objective structured clinical examination (OSCE) to assess technical and communicative skills.
SEMI	NEG	PMC5293440.xml	S24	Introduction	NEG	Additionally, students were asked after the course how well they felt prepared to handle a similar emergency in the future (perceived preparedness).
SEMI	NEG	PMC5293440.xml	S30	Material and methods	NEG	9–11; 45147 Essen, Germany), its faculty board committee on teaching, and the students‘ informed written consent, 2 consecutive classes of medical students were included.
SEMI	NEG	PMC5293440.xml	S32	Material and methods	NEG	Three emergency scenarios were assessed: acute chest pain, stroke, and acute dyspnea/asthma.
SEMI	NEG	PMC5293440.xml	S47	Material and methods	NEG	The effects of the training method were assessed by comparing between the 2 groups the performance in a written examination and a clinical examination at the completion of the course.
SEMI	NEG	PMC5293440.xml	S49	Material and methods	NEG	The multiple-choice questions had been used in previous other cohorts and have successfully been validated.
SEMI	NEG	PMC5293440.xml	S56	Material and methods	NEG	As a performance measure, unrelated to the 3 scenarios being taught, the participants’ performance in a resuscitation scenario (ACLS) using a high-fidelity simulator (METIman, CAE, St.

SEMI	POS	PMC5293440.xml	S110	Discussion	POS	Some limitations of this study should be discussed.
SEMI	POS	PMC5293440.xml	S111	Discussion	POS	Our faculty has strict requirements on the specifics and design of OSCE, and case scenarios must not be longer than 6 minutes.
SEMI	POS	PMC5293440.xml	S112	Discussion	POS	Accordingly, a longer physician–patient interaction might be required to demonstrate even better behavioral skills.
SEMI	POS	PMC5293440.xml	S113	Discussion	POS	Three defined scenarios with the trained standardized patients presenting very specific symptoms were used.
SEMI	POS	PMC5293440.xml	S114	Discussion	POS	Thus, only little patient history taking was required to arrive at a diagnosis.
SEMI	POS	PMC5293440.xml	S115	Discussion	POS	Accordingly, the selected scenarios and the assessment of teaching results might not fully explore the skills acquired by the students by teaching with standardized patients.
SEMI	POS	PMC5293440.xml	S116	Discussion	POS	We did not perform any testing before the course.
SEMI	POS	PMC5293440.xml	S117	Discussion	POS	Thus, we are unable to report a gain in factual knowledge or skills.
SEMI	POS	PMC5293440.xml	S118	Discussion	POS	Our written examinations are not validated to being repeated with different questions for comparison of results, and repeating the OSCE examination, for the purpose of this study, would have created an undesirable training effect.
SEMI	POS	PMC5293440.xml	S119	Discussion	POS	Furthermore, we tested a specific cohort of medical students in an advanced stage of medical training.
SEMI	POS	PMC5293440.xml	S120	Discussion	POS	Potentially, teaching using simulated patients may yield different results in other cohorts, that is, younger medical students, interns, and residents.
SEMI	POS	PMC5293440.xml	S121	Discussion	POS	However, to address effects in all these groups was beyond the scope of our study.
SEMI	POS	PMC5293440.xml	S122	Discussion	POS	In conclusion, teaching handling medical emergencies using standardized patients slightly but significantly improved medical students’ performance in a structured clinical test compared with a traditional seminar cohort, without compromising factual knowledge.
SEMI	POS	PMC5293440.xml	S123	Discussion	POS	Whether this small improvement in student performance is quantitatively meaningful, given tight budgets and a lot of additional resources required must be decided individually.
SEMI	NEG	PMC5293441.xml	S27	Introduction	NEG	In addition, home-based care and monitoring may not only be more economical,[15] but also permit the acquisition of large-scale datasets that have the potential to vastly improve medical decision making through the development of population-specific screening and assessment guidelines.[16,17]
SEMI	NEG	PMC5293441.xml	S31	Introduction	NEG	Our rationale is based on the evidence that musical cues, enriched with rhythm, vocal singing, and uplifting emotional salience stimulate cognitive and arousal systems which in turn can influence motor learning and automaticity (i.e., the ability to perform a skilled movement with minimal executive control).[11,18,19]
SEMI	NEG	PMC5293441.xml	S32	Introduction	NEG	Modern attentional theories of learning predict that long-term motor memory of automatic gait control may benefit from cueing approaches that activate reward and attentional networks.
SEMI	NEG	PMC5293441.xml	S38	Methods	NEG	Ethics approval was obtained from the University Ethics Board for Human Research and informed written consent was obtained.
SEMI	NEG	PMC5293441.xml	S72	Methods	NEG	They were also given an instructional guide which explicitly stated the importance of the device only being used for in-home SIP training, and participants were encouraged to mark a spot on the floor at home and SIP in that location every time they did the training.
SEMI	NEG	PMC5293441.xml	S77	Methods	NEG	Following 4 weeks of in-home SIP training (i.e., auditory contingent SIP training without any DT training), participants were brought back on site to reperform the DT step-automaticity assessment as well as complete the MoCA, FES-I, and FOG-Q (Fig. 1).
SEMI	NEG	PMC5293441.xml	S98	Results	NEG	There was no significant change in these scores (Table 1).
SEMI	NEG	PMC5293441.xml	S121	Discussion	NEG	This allows participants to use real-time biofeedback that may help to self-motivate and self-activate reward networks with training.[36]
SEMI	NEG	PMC5293441.xml	S126	Discussion	NEG	These findings also support the notion that repetitive motor activity alone is not enough for neural plasticity.
SEMI	POS	PMC5293441.xml	S140	Discussion	POS	This pilot study supports feasibility and suggests that in-home music-continent SIP training is efficacious.
SEMI	POS	PMC5293441.xml	S141	Discussion	POS	However, we acknowledge that there are important limitations to this pilot study.
SEMI	POS	PMC5293441.xml	S142	Discussion	POS	First, while we achieved our goal of feasibility testing of the Ambulosono in-home training paradigm, we cannot rule out the possibility that other factors led to the observed improvements such as other forms of physical activity or even continued participation in the PD walking program.
SEMI	POS	PMC5293441.xml	S143	Discussion	POS	However, these patients had already been in the walking program for over a year and were asked to maintain their regular pattern of activity.
SEMI	POS	PMC5293441.xml	S144	Discussion	POS	Nevertheless, future studies should evaluate the current program using a controlled design and covariate-adjusted analysis that can be guided by our calculated Cohen d effect size of approximately 1.
SEMI	POS	PMC5293441.xml	S145	Discussion	POS	Furthermore, although it was not possible to evaluate in the current version of the Ambulosono algorithm, future study and technological development may also aim to assess the number to times that music stopped during training as an index or biobehavioral marker of impaired capability of maintained attention or focus on the task.
SEMI	POS	PMC5293441.xml	S146	Discussion	POS	This potential marker may have important implications that extend beyond that of single disease management and relate to other neurological conditions that exhibit central fatigue.[37]
SEMI	POS	PMC5293441.xml	S147	Discussion	POS	A second limitation and important but unanswered question in this study was whether music-contingent SIP, general music effects, or both, are involved in the observed increases in DT step automaticity, and whether this type of training can improve only stepping automaticity or other types of motor automaticity as well (i.e., transfer effects)?
SEMI	POS	PMC5293441.xml	S148	Discussion	POS	This pilot study was not able to address these specific questions and thus future study is needed.
SEMI	POS	PMC5293441.xml	S149	Discussion	POS	Still, given that The Canadian Centre for Activity and Aging's Home Support Exercise Program recommends SIP for physically inactive seniors,[8] these findings provide encouraging evidence that this type of music-contingent SIP training protocol may be an efficacious approach or provide an “entry level” strategy for certain mobility-restricted patients to increase their level of physical activity and step automaticity.
SEMI	NEG	PMC5293441.xml	S154	Conclusion	NEG	It may also help standardize data collection, facilitate personalized rehabilitation-training program development, and improve reporting across disciplines; ultimately aimed at enhancing primary care delivery and patient monitoring.

SEMI	NEG	PMC5293442.xml	S119	Discussion	NEG	While the basis underlying this weak but significant association is not clear, a possible link may be found in intratumoral inflammatory processes that can contribute to tumor FDG activity.[10]
SEMI	NEG	PMC5293443.xml	S28	Materials and methods	NEG	The height- and weight-measuring instruments were calibrated using the following approach: the participants were placed on the flat ground in a corner, and any error in 2 measurements of body height was less than 0.5 cm.
SEMI	POS	PMC5293443.xml	S126	Discussion	POS	Judging from these potential interfering factors of the renal depth formulae, it is likely that the GFR values measured by Gates’ method might have some limitations.

SEMI	NEG	PMC5293446.xml	S91	Results	NEG	The occurrence of BMD below the expected range for age in premenopause female and men age < 50 years among GC users is significantly higher than controls (34.9% vs 3.7%, P < 0.001; Table 1).
SEMI	NEG	PMC5293446.xml	S153	Discussion	NEG	If we select a BMI fixed at 24 or 25 kg/m2, the influence of BMI on fracture probability might be misestimated.
SEMI	NEG	PMC5293447.xml	S19	Introduction	NEG	DM is reported in up to 52% of ACC patients[7] and can occur with/without LR recurrence.[8]

SEMI	NEG	PMC5293447.xml	S121	Discussion	NEG	Thompson et al[19] suggested patients with sinonasal tract and nasopharyngeal ACC demonstrating lymphovascular invasion had an increased incidence of recurrence and lower survival probability.
SEMI	NEG	PMC5293447.xml	S158	Discussion	NEG	Surprizingly, in our analysis, the inclusion of postoperative RT did not appear to impact LR recurrence, DM, or OS (Fig. 3).
SEMI	NEG	PMC5293448.xml	S29	Abstract	NEG	A 2-year-old male patient presented to our hospital with history of leg pain for 4 months.
SEMI	NEG	PMC5293448.xml	S23	Introduction	NEG	And the studies about effective methods for large bone defect in patients younger than 3 years are rare in literature.
SEMI	NEG	PMC5293448.xml	S40	Case	NEG	X-ray 3 months after the operation showed calcium sulfate artificial bone was replaced by autologous bone (Fig. 6).
SEMI	POS	PMC5293448.xml	S95	Discussion	POS	This technique still has some limitations.
SEMI	POS	PMC5293448.xml	S96	Discussion	POS	These local nutrition branches of fibular artery prevent the graft distance of the fibula, leading to fusion between the section side in the fibula and fracture site in the tibia.
SEMI	POS	PMC5293448.xml	S97	Discussion	POS	Whether such fusion will affect the long-term alignment abnormality or joint dysfunction still needs further observation.
SEMI	NEG	PMC5293449.xml	S26	Introduction	NEG	Based on meta-analysis,[7–9] experts have recommended the use of repeated doses of corticosteroids in patients with a positive CLT.
SEMI	NEG	PMC5293449.xml	S50	Materials and methods	NEG	Oral and endotracheal suctioning were performed before the cuff was deflated.
SEMI	NEG	PMC5293449.xml	S73	Materials and methods	NEG	Statistical analysis was performed using STATA 14.0 (StataCorp LP, College Station, TX).
SEMI	NEG	PMC5293449.xml	S85	Results	NEG	This resulted in 2 self-extubations (12%) and 9 FOL-guided extubations (53%) in the corticosteroids group as requested by the attending physician after failure of the corticosteroids strategy to allow extubation after 24 hours.
SEMI	NEG	PMC5293450.xml	S4	Abstract	NEG	Retrospective chart review was performed on patients undergoing computed tomography angiography with standard contrast protocol (n = 50) or individualized protocol (n = 50).
SEMI	NEG	PMC5293450.xml	S9	Abstract	NEG	Individualized contrast protocol provided comparable vascular enhancement and image quality to the standard, yet with fewer limitations and lower intravenous contrast volume.
SEMI	NEG	PMC5293450.xml	S14	Introduction	NEG	Mortality can be reduced through early diagnosis and treatment, although clinical manifestations can often be nonspecific, necessitating accurate and efficient imaging.
SEMI	NEG	PMC5293450.xml	S16	Introduction	NEG	Pulmonary CTA poses a familiar quandary of achieving maximum luminal enhancement of target vessels while minimizing mediastinal and perivascular streak artifact from undiluted contrast material in neighboring venous structures.
SEMI	NEG	PMC5293450.xml	S22	Introduction	NEG	The purpose of the study is to compare an individualized contrast protocol to the use of a standard protocol and to identify factors that influence the clinical utility, contrast usage, and limitations in process consistency when performing chest CTA for the evaluation of acute PE.
SEMI	NEG	PMC5293450.xml	S32	Materials and methods	NEG	The P3T software adapts the Iodine delivery rate (gI/s) based upon a nonlinear relationship between patient weight and scan duration.
SEMI	NEG	PMC5293450.xml	S34	Materials and methods	NEG	The volumetric flow rate for all contrast phases varies as a function of the patient weight and the Iodine concentration of the contrast.
SEMI	NEG	PMC5293450.xml	S39	Materials and methods	NEG	A key principle in rationale contrast protocol design is ensuring the injection duration of the contrast bolus is sufficient to anticipate the dispersive effects of the cardiopulmonary system.
SEMI	NEG	PMC5293450.xml	S42	Materials and methods	NEG	For fast data acquisitions typical at high-pitch CTA (∼5 seconds), the software restricts the injection duration of the contrast-only phase to a configurable minimum value, ranging between 6 and 16 seconds.
SEMI	NEG	PMC5293450.xml	S48	Materials and methods	NEG	Unique subject identifiers and a data collection tool created and pilot tested by the investigators were used to record patient demographics.
SEMI	NEG	PMC5293450.xml	S72	Materials and methods	NEG	Three board-certified, fellowship-trained radiologists specializing in either cross-sectional imaging or interventional radiology were recruited to quantitatively and qualitatively assess the axial CT images.
SEMI	NEG	PMC5293450.xml	S78	Materials and methods	NEG	The mean HU, standard deviation (SD), and ROI were reported for each region.
SEMI	NEG	PMC5293450.xml	S81	Materials and methods	NEG	Two radiologists independently assessed the diagnostic image quality as: “diagnostic without limitation,” “diagnostic with limitation,” or “nondiagnostic.” Diagnostic limiting factors identified within a region were categorized as either: technical (related to contrast administration such as streak/streaming artifact and/or poor enhancement or patient-related (motion artifact, surgical resection, and/or presence of synchronous disease states such as malignancy, pneumonia, or congestive heart failure).
SEMI	NEG	PMC5293450.xml	S89	Materials and methods	NEG	Categorical patient variables and qualitative measures (image quality) were compared with the Pearson χ2 or Fisher exact tests.
SEMI	NEG	PMC5293450.xml	S98	Results	NEG	Patients in this study were generally older adults with a mean age of 61.06 years (SD = 15.58, range = 16–94).
SEMI	NEG	PMC5293450.xml	S99	Results	NEG	Patient demographics were comparable between the groups; however, more patients in the individualized group were admitted to the intensive care unit (ICU) (48% vs 16%, P = 0.004).
SEMI	NEG	PMC5293450.xml	S112	Results	NEG	Technical limitations associated with the individualized protocol were, in fact, higher than those associated with the standardized protocol (5 [83.3%] out of 6 patients vs 2 (40%) out of 5 patients, respectively).
SEMI	POS	PMC5293450.xml	S134	Discussion	POS	A limitation of this study is the not representative cohort of patients studied.
SEMI	POS	PMC5293450.xml	S135	Discussion	POS	This prohibits formulating a strong argument in favor of using a personalized IV contrast delivery system (in lieu of the more conventional standardized protocols commonly in use) despite its capability to generate diagnostic image quality regardless of the patient's clinical condition.
SEMI	POS	PMC5293450.xml	S136	Discussion	POS	As the flagship institution within the largest integrated delivery network in Illinois, our hospital was the first to implement this alternative contrast delivery software.
SEMI	POS	PMC5293450.xml	S137	Discussion	POS	Consequently, there was widespread interest in learning of our initial results.
SEMI	POS	PMC5293450.xml	S138	Discussion	POS	During the course of analyzing the results, we discovered that the computer-generated algorithm was not consistently implemented by the CT technologists in approximately 25% of the cases and specifically when catheters smaller than 18-gauge were used.
SEMI	POS	PMC5293450.xml	S139	Discussion	POS	To match these outlier examinations to the qualitative assessments in an effort to formulate a reasonable conclusion is an issue to be explored with future study.
SEMI	POS	PMC5293450.xml	S140	Discussion	POS	The flow rates calculated by the software were manually reduced by the technologist to avoid exceeding the flow rate recommendations in the catheter system package insert.
SEMI	POS	PMC5293450.xml	S141	Discussion	POS	This introduced lower flow rates than desired which we feel compromised the effectiveness of target vessel enhancement.
SEMI	POS	PMC5293450.xml	S142	Discussion	POS	This is a legitimate concern when imaging larger patients requiring higher iodine concentrations via maximum contrast volume and delivery velocity.[14]
SEMI	POS	PMC5293450.xml	S143	Discussion	POS	Despite the questionable significance of this limitation, the outcomes with respect to vessel opacification were nearly identical for the 2 assessed protocols.
SEMI	POS	PMC5293450.xml	S144	Discussion	POS	Although the difference in enhancement did not reach statistical significance, a slight advantage observed with the individualized contrast protocol is worth noting.
SEMI	POS	PMC5293450.xml	S145	Discussion	POS	These observations suggest that a true advantage, as demonstrated by Deible et al,[15] may exist with strict adherence to the algorithm using a larger-sized catheter system.
SEMI	POS	PMC5293450.xml	S146	Discussion	POS	The results of this study, although not conclusive, are nevertheless promising.
SEMI	POS	PMC5293450.xml	S147	Discussion	POS	Potential variability in study parameters and patient acuity levels inherent to the utilization of retrospective design limit standardization and therefore the ability to collect complete information on study patients.
SEMI	POS	PMC5293450.xml	S148	Discussion	POS	Our findings would support the advantage in using individualized protocols in the CTA evaluation for acute PE phenomenon when all other scan technique variables are kept constant and a large bore needle is used.
SEMI	POS	PMC5293450.xml	S149	Discussion	POS	The challenges encountered are not unique to this study, have been and will continue to be investigated as the multidetector CT technology continually evolves.
SEMI	POS	PMC5293450.xml	S150	Discussion	POS	Future research is indicated in quantifying the combined positive effects of individualized contrast administration and larger gauge catheters (and therefore higher flow rates), under specific conditions of multidetector CTA in the evaluation of acute PE from both a clinical and cost effectiveness perspective.
SEMI	POS	PMC5293450.xml	S151	Discussion	POS	Prospective studies utilizing larger sample sizes and matched cases (based on relevant demographic and clinical characteristics) are needed to assess the relationship between weight-based IV contrast volume administration and decreased occurrence of dose-dependent adverse reactions such as renal toxicity in at-risk patients.
SEMI	NEG	PMC5293450.xml	S154	Discussion	NEG	The technologists in our CT department underwent intensive training during the implementation of the individualized weight-based IV contrast delivery system.

SEMI	NEG	PMC5293451.xml	S130	Discussion	NEG	Additionally, radiation therapy can cause mucositis and xerostomia and significantly increases the secondary cancer risk.
SEMI	NEG	PMC5293452.xml	S22	Introduction	NEG	Consequently, early radiological detection of subtle changes of WM microstructures due to CO intoxication should be urgently needed.
SEMI	NEG	PMC5293452.xml	S124	Results	NEG	On the contrary, a visually perceivable decrease of the MK value in the genu of corpus callosum was noticed in this representative patient (Fig. 5H, black arrow).
SEMI	NEG	PMC5293452.xml	S148	Discussion	NEG	Notwithstanding, the non-Gaussian DKI could offer an improved sensitivity in revealing neural microstructure changes due to ischemic stroke or multiple sclerosis,[32,33] our study further proved that DKI is superior to DTI in detecting early CO-induced white matter injury.
SEMI	NEG	PMC5293452.xml	S191	Discussion	NEG	In conclusion, DKI could provide more information, such as directional and MK, than does the conventional DTI, thus could contribute to the early detection of cerebral microstructural changes and may help predict the late complications such as delayed encephalopathy in patients after CO intoxication.

SEMI	NEG	PMC5293455.xml	S44	Methods	NEG	Time between stent implantation and control coronary angiography due to acute coronary syndrome was calculated and stent thrombosis was defined as acute (between 24 hours), subacute (24 hours–30 days), late (30 days–1 year), and very late (after 1 year) thrombosis.[14]
SEMI	NEG	PMC5293455.xml	S48	Methods	NEG	The independent sample t test or the Mann–Whitney U test was used for the continuous variables and the chi-square test for categorical variables.
SEMI	NEG	PMC5293455.xml	S84	Discussion	NEG	Third, rate of stent thrombosis was more higher in 3rd tertile where the patients had the highest mean RDW values.
SEMI	POS	PMC5293455.xml	S118	Limitations	POS	Our study has several limitations.
SEMI	POS	PMC5293455.xml	S119	Limitations	POS	First it was a retrospective study.

SEMI	POS	PMC5293456.xml	S166		POS	This study has a number of limitations.
SEMI	POS	PMC5293456.xml	S167		POS	First, the sample size was small, mainly due to an important number of women who could not be located or who were not being followed up when the study was conducted.
SEMI	POS	PMC5293456.xml	S168		POS	This was especially relevant in the largest hospitals (Madrid and Valencia), which are reference centers for HIV.

SEMI	NEG	PMC5293457.xml	S105	Discussion	NEG	We preferred fresh frozen allografts along with local bone chips for this purpose.
SEMI	NEG	PMC5293457.xml	S123	Discussion	NEG	Our study is foremost to discuss the effect of teriparatide on multilevel posterolateral fusions in elderly patients.
SEMI	POS	PMC5293457.xml	S135	Limitations	POS	Being a retrospective study, there are few methodological shortcomings that may have influenced our outcome.

SEMI	NEG	PMC5293459.xml	S95	Discussion	NEG	But, the multivariate analysis showed that type of resection was not an independent prognostic factor for the entire cohort.
SEMI	NEG	PMC5293460.xml	S8	Abstract	NEG	None of the patients had severe hyponatremia after preparation for RAI therapy.
SEMI	NEG	PMC5293460.xml	S54	Methods	NEG	Correlations between continuous variables for laboratory data were determined based on Pearson correlation coefficient.

SEMI	NEG	PMC5293470.xml	S15	Abstract	NEG	The technique of intraoperative transillumination with water-filling of lumen allows simple, accurate, and rapid localization of lesions in occult small bowel bleeding and facilitates precise and definitive surgery.
SEMI	NEG	PMC5293470.xml	S20	Introduction	NEG	Despite the existence of endoscopic localization and therapy with video capsule endoscopy and double-balloon enteroscopy,[3–5] exact localization of obscure small bowel bleeds still poses a challenge.
SEMI	NEG	PMC5293470.xml	S41	Case report	NEG	All the vessels appeared remarkably uniform, except in 1 area, located 60 cm away from the cecum, where a slightly tortuous vessel with gossamer-like bleed floating in the water was clearly seen to be macroscopically totally distinct from all others (Fig. 1).
SEMI	NEG	PMC5293470.xml	S62	Discussion	NEG	For the surgeon, the main technical problem is that even when identified preoperatively by endoscopy or angiography, lesions are notoriously difficult to locate at laparotomy, being frequently impalpable, and invisible to the naked eye.
SEMI	NEG	PMC5293471.xml	S19		NEG	Dextrocardia, that is right-lying heart, is a rare congenital heart defect in which the heart is predominantly localized on the right side of the thorax.[1]
SEMI	NEG	PMC5293471.xml	S35		NEG	Approximately 1 year before admission, the patient had started having palpitations and malaise, and a number of ECG examinations revealed sinus bradycardia with a heart rate of ∼45 beats per min (bpm) (Supplemental Fig. 1).
SEMI	NEG	PMC5293471.xml	S48		NEG	Consistent with the diagnosis of dextrocardia, we found that the right atrium was located on the lower left section of the heart (Fig. 2), and that the right ventricle was located on the lower right section of the heart (Fig. 3).
SEMI	NEG	PMC5293471.xml	S76		NEG	In this particular case, the major challenge was determining how to smoothly guide the electrode into the right ventricle via tricuspid valve.
SEMI	NEG	PMC5293472.xml	S9	Abstract	NEG	Postoperative ASD was developed in 15 of 237 patients (6.3%) at final follow up.
SEMI	NEG	PMC5293472.xml	S10	Abstract	NEG	There was no statistically significant difference between the 2 groups in patient characteristics of age, sex composition, BMD, duration, while the BMI was higher in ASD group than that in N-ASD group.

SEMI	NEG	PMC5293473.xml	S96	Discussion	NEG	There are many echocardiographic technologies available for the evaluation.
SEMI	NEG	PMC5293473.xml	S105	Discussion	NEG	In this study, we demonstrated that chronic asymptomatic alcoholics (mild and moderate alcoholic groups) had increased LV mass and LV dilation.
SEMI	NEG	PMC5293473.xml	S109	Discussion	NEG	The LVM and LVMI were significantly increased in the mild group, whereas the EDV and ESV from the mild group remained insignificant with the control group.

SEMI	NEG	PMC5293474.xml	S87	Results	NEG	Resultant variable: Y = 1 for the patient with hepatic dysfunction, and Y = 0 for the patient without hepatic dysfunction.
SEMI	NEG	PMC5293474.xml	S138	Discussion	NEG	Additionally, our study revealed that progntosis of hepatic dysfunction was associated with the outcomes of Graves’ hyperthyroidism.
SEMI	NEG	PMC5293475.xml	S65		NEG	In this cohort, medical information was obtained from patient self-reports, physical examination, and laboratory test results in our computerized database (Asan Biomedical Research Environment).
SEMI	NEG	PMC5293475.xml	S69		NEG	Healthy nondonors were evaluated for the development of CKD.

SEMI	NEG	PMC5293475.xml	S77		NEG	Multivariate Cox proportional hazard regression analyses were used to assess the prognostic value of Cys-C concentration in CKD development; the proportional-hazards assumption for each variable was checked using Schoenfeld residuals and the double-log method.
SEMI	NEG	PMC5293476.xml	S40	Materials and methods	NEG	In addition, 2 authors were responsible for data analyses.
SEMI	NEG	PMC5293476.xml	S88	Discussion	NEG	Operation time was regarded as a biggest risk factor for SSI previously.[16]
SEMI	POS	PMC5293476.xml	S94	Discussion	POS	The present study has several limitations.
SEMI	POS	PMC5293476.xml	S95	Discussion	POS	First, it was a retrospective study, we need to conduct a prospective study to further explore the risk factors for SSI after posterior lumbar surgery; second, some factors could not be observed due to retrospective study, for example, whether improving TP and albumin to normal level before surgery could reduce risk of SSI or not; relation between subcutaneous fat thickness and SSI; operating room is closed or not during surgery; how many doctors in operative room, and so on; third, data on microbiology was not analyzed due to lack of related data or incomplete data.
SEMI	NEG	PMC5293477.xml	S29	Introduction	NEG	CLF has been widely used for many years for treating MCSM caused by multilevel cervical spinal cord compression.
SEMI	NEG	PMC5293477.xml	S77	Results	NEG	Furthermore, no minor side effects associated with the use of TXA such as nausea, vomiting, headache, or diarrhea occurred in either of the groups.
SEMI	NEG	PMC5293477.xml	S83	Discussion	NEG	The principal disadvantage of this approach is a significant decrease in motion due to the fixation of the target vertebrae.
SEMI	NEG	PMC5293477.xml	S85	Discussion	NEG	For patients with MCSM combined with simple instability or correctable kyphosis, CLF is a more suitable method than laminoplasty, even if the consequence is neck stiffness.
SEMI	NEG	PMC5293478.xml	S6	Abstract	NEG	This prompted us to study whether there is an association between hypertension and another iron overload-associated gene, hemojuvelin (HJV), which has 2 common polymorphic sites (rs 16827043, rs7536827).
SEMI	NEG	PMC5293478.xml	S8	Abstract	NEG	All participants were 50- year-old Finnish men and women, and the data was collected from the Tampere adult population cardiovascular risk study (TAMRISK).
SEMI	NEG	PMC5293478.xml	S11	Abstract	NEG	The risk was even higher when overweight subjects (BMI>30) were excluded from the analyses.
SEMI	NEG	PMC5293478.xml	S14	Abstract	NEG	Previous studies together with the present one indicate that individuals with possible dysregulation of iron metabolism may have higher risk for hypertension than those with normal iron homeostasis.
SEMI	NEG	PMC5293479.xml	S6	Abstract	NEG	We report a case of presternal subcutaneous bronchogenic cyst in an 18-year-old man with unusual ultrasonographic findings.
SEMI	NEG	PMC5293479.xml	S16	Introduction	NEG	The majority of bronchogenic cysts are typically found in the thorax, mediastinum, or pulmonary parenchyma [1,2]; only rarely have subcutaneous bronchogenic cysts also been described.
SEMI	NEG	PMC5293479.xml	S37	Case report	NEG	The differential diagnosis of subcutaneous cyst included epidermal inclusion cyst, thyroglossal duct cyst, branchial cleft cyst, and dermoid cyst.
SEMI	NEG	PMC5293479.xml	S55	Discussion	NEG	Total excision is thus advised for the treatment of subcutaneous bronchogenic cysts.[11,13,17–18]
SEMI	NEG	PMC5293480.xml	S4	Abstract	NEG	Chronic diarrhea in adult patients due to various causes is very common in clinic, but patient suffering with mal-absorption due to immunoproliferative small intestinal disease was rarely reported in China.
SEMI	NEG	PMC5293480.xml	S56	Case report	NEG	The laboratory investigation manifested that the value of immunoglobulin A protein titer in serum decreased to 16,700 mg/L.
SEMI	NEG	PMC5293480.xml	S63	Discussion	NEG	According to her high level of polyclonal immunoglobulin A in serum and massive infiltration of mature plasma cells in intestine, we diagnosed this patient with an immunoproliferative small intestinal disease.
SEMI	NEG	PMC5293480.xml	S77	Discussion	NEG	We found polyclonal immunoglobulin protein but not M protein band on immunoelectrophoresis, because of the polymerized and accumulated alpha-heavy chain proteins in this patient, who had a normal level of kappa and lambda light chain in the serum.
SEMI	NEG	PMC5293481.xml	S48	Case Presentation	NEG	After a 3-day period of pain free (numerical rating scale: 0) postoperatively, she reported moderate to good pain relief with a numerical rating scale of about 3 to 4 lasting 1 month after the first injection.

SEMI	NEG	PMC5293481.xml	S63	Discussion	NEG	Although the mechanisms underlying the effect of stellate ganglion block on various pathologies is not completely understood, it is conceivable and plausible that wide indication implies wide ranges of mechanisms as sympathetic nervous system is interconnected throughout the whole body.
SEMI	NEG	PMC5293481.xml	S74	Conclusions	NEG	Further studies are needed to define its potential role in the treatment of thalamic pain.
SEMI	NEG	PMC5293482.xml	S6	Abstract	NEG	In most cases of supracardiac type, the common venous confluence drains through an ascending left vertical vein into the brachiocephalic vein, right superior vena cava, and then into the right atrium.
SEMI	NEG	PMC5293482.xml	S27	Introduction	NEG	These symptoms depend mostly on the degree of venous obstruction; therefore, the symptoms will increase in severity at the same time with the degree of venous obstruction.[4]
SEMI	NEG	PMC5293482.xml	S50	Case report	NEG	On further assessment, a very narrow opening of the confluence into the right SVC was detected (Fig. 4).
SEMI	NEG	PMC5293482.xml	S71	Case report	NEG	The neonate underwent an emergency open heart surgery by performing a side-to-side anastomosis between the pulmonary venous confluence and left atrium.
SEMI	NEG	PMC5293483.xml	S26	Introduction	NEG	Though the function and operational method of these intra-articular receptors have not been clearly confirmed, they were thought to contribute to the proprioception by detecting changes in tension, acceleration, direction of movement, and position of the knee joint.[11,12]
SEMI	NEG	PMC5293483.xml	S114	Discussion	NEG	A significant positive correlation was observed between the number of mechanoreceptors and the proprioceptive function of the knee joint.[11]
SEMI	NEG	PMC5293483.xml	S134	Discussion	NEG	However, the limitation of above studies is lack of a large-scale sample and successive observation.
SEMI	NEG	PMC5293483.xml	S150	Discussion	NEG	This study has shown that residual mechanoreceptors do exist in the tibial remnants of the ruptured anterior cruciate ligament in human knees and identified clearly by using immunohistochemistry staining.
SEMI	NEG	PMC5293839.xml	S55		NEG	Sufficient RV adaption to PAB seems to be age-dependent not at least by the chance of young children to grow in PAB, which may prevent the need for rebanding.12
SEMI	NEG	PMC5293839.xml	S67		NEG	The endogenous neurohumoral activation, which occurs in all forms of heart failure, should be inhibited, especially in severe forms of LV-DCM; the myocardiocytes and cardiac interstitium need to be protected against the additional mechanical stress of PAB.
SEMI	NEG	PMC5293839.xml	S82		NEG	Based on our experiences with neonates born with a hypoplastic left-heart complex,24 the use of fenestration in the Fontan circulation and the effects of a restrictive left-to-right shunt in patients with RCM and DCM, we hypothesise that a defined interatrial communication might improve congestive symptoms and reduce the incidence of atrial tachyarrhythmia (eg, atrial fibrillation) in these settings.
SEMI	NEG	PMC5293839.xml	S114		NEG	Some congenital conditions may serve as a model disease that may eventually lead to novel therapy options for heart failure.
SEMI	NEG	PMC5293840.xml	S23	Introduction	NEG	Furthermore, data from registries suggest that AC therapy is underused in patients at high stroke risk and potentially overused in those at low stroke risk.7–11

SEMI	NEG	PMC5293840.xml	S47	Methods	NEG	Chronic kidney disease (CKD) was classified according to the National Kidney Foundation's Kidney Disease Outcomes Quality Initiative (NKF KDOQI) guidelines:13 moderate-to-severe includes stages III to V; none or mild includes all other patients.
SEMI	NEG	PMC5293840.xml	S111	Discussion	NEG	It appears that, despite compelling evidence for the use of NOACs in secondary prevention,27–30 prescribers remain relatively wary of NOAC thromboprophylaxis in patients with prior thromboembolic events, predominantly stroke.
SEMI	NEG	PMC5294875.xml	S14	Background	NEG	From all comorbidity categories, having another chronic respiratory disease beside COPD showed the highest risk for developing a new exacerbation (Cox hazard ratio 1.26; 1.17–1.36).

SEMI	NEG	PMC5294875.xml	S55	Methods	NEG	The comorbidities were clustered and analyzed based on their ICPC codes into the following 14 categories: respiratory; cardiovascular; digestive; endocrine; metabolic/nutrition; musculoskeletal; neurologic; psychiatric; urogenital; blood (−forming organs)/lymphatics; infectious; eye/ear/skin; non-pulmonary cancer; and pulmonary cancer.
SEMI	NEG	PMC5294875.xml	S72	Methods	NEG	Subsequently, all frequent and cardiopulmonary comorbidities (Table 2), age, and gender were included as covariates in multivariate Cox regression analyses.
SEMI	NEG	PMC5294875.xml	S73	Methods	NEG	The model was reduced through backward exclusion to produce a final model that consisted of only non-collinear, independently associated, statistically significant covariates.
SEMI	NEG	PMC5294875.xml	S77	Methods	NEG	This modeling approach was also used to analyze the 14 categories of comorbidity.
SEMI	NEG	PMC5294875.xml	S84	Results	NEG	Mean (SD) age was 66 · 5 (11 · 5) years and 53% were males.
SEMI	NEG	PMC5294875.xml	S119	Discussion	NEG	Intuitively, the observed lower risk of frequent exacerbations in COPD patients with comorbid diabetes might be sought in GPs’ reluctance to prescribe oral corticosteroids in these patients because the impact this may have on glucose levels, but a survey among Dutch GPs showed that most of them do not adjust treatment of exacerbations to the presence of diabetic comorbidity [24].
SEMI	NEG	PMC5294875.xml	S120	Discussion	NEG	Gastroesophageal reflux disease (OR = 1.25 (95% CI 1.03–1.50) in our analyses) was recognized as a significant predictor of acute exacerbations of COPD in a recent review by Lee et al [25].
SEMI	NEG	PMC5294875.xml	S124	Discussion	NEG	However, the main strength is not so much the uniqueness or even the size of our dataset.
SEMI	POS	PMC5294875.xml	S132	Discussion	POS	Limited agreement between medical record-based and objectively identified comorbidities of COPD [30] and undiagnosed comorbidity in COPD patients is common [18, 31].
SEMI	POS	PMC5294875.xml	S133	Discussion	POS	This may have resulted in underestimation of the presence of comorbidity in our study population.
SEMI	POS	PMC5294875.xml	S134	Discussion	POS	The use of real-life data presents limitations, for instance the fact that patients’ smoking history and lung function could not be included because this information is not consistently and uniformly documented in general practice medical records.
SEMI	POS	PMC5294875.xml	S135	Discussion	POS	We chose to limit the analyses to comorbidities with a relatively high (i.e., ≥5%) prevalence.
SEMI	POS	PMC5294875.xml	S136	Discussion	POS	This may mean that comorbidities that are related to increased exacerbation risk but have a low prevalence rate in the COPD patient population were missed.
SEMI	POS	PMC5294875.xml	S137	Discussion	POS	We defined an exacerbation as an oral corticosteroid prescription, which is the recommended treatment for acute exacerbations in Dutch COPD guidelines [15].
SEMI	POS	PMC5294875.xml	S138	Discussion	POS	Consequently, mild exacerbations treated with bronchodilators only are not included in our analyses.
SEMI	POS	PMC5294875.xml	S139	Discussion	POS	Oral steroid prescriptions during GP out-of-office hours, emergency department visits and hospitalizations, and prescriptions by pulmonary specialists may not always have been included for all patients, as these are not automatically added to patients’ medical records in all electronic patient record systems.
SEMI	POS	PMC5294875.xml	S140	Discussion	POS	Because there is no international consensus about a definition that discriminates relapse of an earlier exacerbation from a new one, our (arbitrary) choice to use an interval of ≥14 days since the end date of the previous oral steroid prescription may have led to under- or overestimation of the number of exacerbations.
SEMI	POS	PMC5294875.xml	S141	Discussion	POS	Unfortunately, the rather crude prescription information did not allow us to look at the impact of comorbidities on the duration or progression of exacerbations.
SEMI	POS	PMC5294875.xml	S142	Discussion	POS	Although observational studies such as ours lack the rigorous internal validity that is typical for randomized controlled trials, they provide valuable insight into comorbidity prevalence in COPD and its relation with an important outcome, i.e., exacerbations.
SEMI	POS	PMC5294875.xml	S143	Discussion	POS	As such, our findings should be considered in conjunction with those arising from other study designs, including randomized trials.
SEMI	NEG	PMC5294875.xml	S150	Discussion	NEG	Neither does Putcha’s score take differences in exacerbation risk for different comorbidities into account.
SEMI	NEG	PMC5299097.xml	S40		NEG	Myocardial infarctions presenting as sudden death (type 3), or after percutaneous coronary intervention (type 4) and coronary artery bypass grafting (type 5) are also defined.
SEMI	NEG	PMC5299097.xml	S105		NEG	The diagnosis is pulmonary embolism and acute myocardial injury due to hypoxia or right ventricular strain; coronary investigations and secondary prevention are not indicated.
SEMI	NEG	PMC5299097.xml	S125		NEG	There is an unmet need for novel risk prediction scores or validation of existing tools, such as the GRACE score, to guide clinicians when assessing patients with acute myocardial injury.
SEMI	NEG	PMC5299097.xml	S129		NEG	Where type 1 myocardial infarction is confirmed, application of the GRACE score confers important prognostic information.15
SEMI	NEG	PMC5299098.xml	S17		NEG	The Heart manuscript by Shen et al9 expands on this important theme, investigating whether CT calcium scoring is likely to be of clinical use in patients with bicuspid valves and in younger patients with AS.
SEMI	NEG	PMC5299098.xml	S27		NEG	The story however appeared different in the cohort of patients with a bicuspid aortic valve.
SEMI	NEG	PMC5299098.xml	S35		NEG	Perhaps the first question to address is whether it predominantly represents a function of the bicuspid structure of the valve or of patient age (subjects in this group were substantially younger than the patients in the trileaflet group).
SEMI	NEG	PMC5299098.xml	S38		NEG	The alternative explanation is that this phenomenon instead simply reflects a function of age.
SEMI	NEG	PMC5299687.xml	S9	Background	NEG	Precision-cut lung slices (PCLS) were prepared from guinea pigs.
SEMI	NEG	PMC5299687.xml	S117	Methods	NEG	The ELISA-kits were acquired from Enzo (Lörrach, Germany).
SEMI	NEG	PMC5299687.xml	S152	Results	NEG	Nebulization of imatinib (calculated dosage: 2 mg/kg body weight) reduced the ET-1-induced increase of Rpost from the time points 110 – 150 min, but Rpost was still significantly increased (p <0.001) compared to control lungs (Fig. 5b).
SEMI	NEG	PMC5299687.xml	S249	Discussion	NEG	These considerations support the idea that the contractile effect of PDGF-BB is prevented by inhibition of PDGFR-β [32–37, 72–75].
SEMI	NEG	PMC5300027.xml	S37	METHODS	NEG	The criteria for highest activation include: Glasgow Coma Score ≤10, heart rate >120 beats per minute, systolic blood pressure ≤90, respiratory rate <10 or >29 per minute, intubation, penetrating injury to torso, groin, head or neck, amputation proximal to ankle or wrist, paraplegia, quadriplegia, uncontrolled external hemorrhage, fracture to pelvis or two or more long bone fractures, and receiving blood en route.
SEMI	NEG	PMC5300027.xml	S47	METHODS	NEG	This excluded burn injury patients (n = 64) and an additional 73 patients [ie, nontrauma (n = 2), missing ISS (n = 42), and missing biomarkers (n = 29)].
SEMI	NEG	PMC5300027.xml	S55	METHODS	NEG	Blood was transferred into vacutainer tubes containing 3.2% citrate and inverted to ensure proper anticoagulation.
SEMI	NEG	PMC5300027.xml	S120	DISCUSSION	NEG	Together, these findings support that downstream effects of excessive sympathoadrenal activation may also be harmful in shocked patients 8,37 making it tempting to speculate if low-dose beta-blockers may be beneficial in these patients.
SEMI	NEG	PMC5300029.xml	S110	RESULTS	NEG	Univariate analyses were performed on age, sex, LMR, NLR, PLR, and clinicopathologic factors to determine their association with OS.
SEMI	NEG	PMC5300029.xml	S147	DISCUSSION	NEG	The association that monocytes may be useful has, however, only recently been evaluated and found to be prognostic.
SEMI	NEG	PMC5300029.xml	S161	DISCUSSION	NEG	Before this finding, studies had generally reported the NLR to be superior to the PLR5,22,23; however, we found neither the NLR nor the PLR to be independently prognostic when studied together with the LMR.
SEMI	NEG	PMC5300029.xml	S163	DISCUSSION	NEG	This not only reaffirms the reproducibility of hematologic markers across differing populations, but also strengthens the argument that the LMR is a superior predictor.
SEMI	NEG	PMC5300030.xml	S15	Objective:	NEG	At this interim 3-year time point, comorbidities were significantly reduced and comparable after both procedures except for gastro-esophageal reflux disease and dyslipidemia, which were more successfully treated by LRYGB.
SEMI	NEG	PMC5300030.xml	S20	Objective:	NEG	Improvement of comorbidities is similar except for gastro-esophageal reflux disease and dyslipidemia that appear to be more successfully treated by LRYGB.
SEMI	NEG	PMC5300030.xml	S44	METHODS	NEG	To summarize, the trial was a 2-group, randomized, controlled, multicenter study involving 217 morbidly obese patients, in which the outcomes of LSG were compared to those of LRYGB.
SEMI	NEG	PMC5300030.xml	S141	DISCUSSION	NEG	The present study explored whether LSG compared with the current gold standard in bariatric surgery, laparoscopic gastric bypass (LRYGB) is equally effective in: 1) weight loss, 2) remission of comorbidities, 3) increase in quality of life, and 4) whether the 2 procedures are equally safe in long-term outcome.
SEMI	NEG	PMC5300031.xml	S9	Objective:	NEG	Surgical cases categorized as clean and undergoing no secondary procedures unrelated to mastectomy were included.
SEMI	NEG	PMC5300031.xml	S129	DISCUSSION	NEG	Classically, 3 to 6 weeks has been suggested to allow normalization of laboratory values, to permit the patient to regain general well-being, and to allow the patient to recover from the effects of chemotherapy to safely undergo the procedure.
SEMI	POS	PMC5300031.xml	S132	DISCUSSION	POS	In this study, the exact timing of surgery after neoadjuvant chemotherapy is not known due to database limitations.
SEMI	POS	PMC5300031.xml	S133	DISCUSSION	POS	However, the fact that surgery may have been performed earlier than the aforementioned wait times strengthens the finding that neoadjuvant chemotherapy does not increase risk.
SEMI	NEG	PMC5300032.xml	S3	Objective:	NEG	We sought to determine 30-day survival trends and prognostic factors following surgery for acute subdural hematomas (ASDHs) in England and Wales over a 20-year period.
SEMI	NEG	PMC5300032.xml	S5	Objective:	NEG	ASDHs are still considered the most lethal type of traumatic brain injury.
SEMI	NEG	PMC5300032.xml	S9	Objective:	NEG	Two thousand four hundred ninety-eight eligible cases were identified.
SEMI	NEG	PMC5300032.xml	S14	Objective:	NEG	Mechanism of injury was due to a fall (<2 m 34%, >2 m 24%), road traffic collision (25%), and other (17%).
SEMI	NEG	PMC5300032.xml	S20	Objective:	NEG	A significant improvement in survival over the last 20 years was observed after controlling for multiple prognostic factors.
SEMI	NEG	PMC5300032.xml	S56	METHODS	NEG	Variables hypothesized to be related to survival were modeled using univariate logistic regression, retained as continuous variables where possible to maximize statistical utility.21,22
SEMI	NEG	PMC5300032.xml	S57	METHODS	NEG	The date of injury was converted to a decimal, such that the exact point in the year in which the injury occurred could be retained.
SEMI	NEG	PMC5300032.xml	S65	METHODS	NEG	Nonlinear variables in this study were all modeled using restricted cubic splines.
SEMI	NEG	PMC5300032.xml	S67	METHODS	NEG	Multiple imputation was then applied in the updated dataset.
SEMI	NEG	PMC5300032.xml	S68	METHODS	NEG	Sensitivity was tested under multiple logistic regression analysis in 3 ways, firstly, using an offset ranging between the maximum and minimum of the variable in question, with restrictions such that any imputed data did not exceed the highest and lowest possible values.24,25
SEMI	NEG	PMC5300032.xml	S73	METHODS	NEG	This methodology was undertaken to minimize bias as a result of nonrandomization, and was performed through a one-to-one nearest neighbor method matching process.26
SEMI	NEG	PMC5300032.xml	S76	METHODS	NEG	All analyses were performed using package rms in R, version 2.15.2.27,28 Logistic regression output was converted to a probability of survival for graphical presentation.
SEMI	NEG	PMC5300032.xml	S102	RESULTS	NEG	Median values of continuous variables and modal values of discrete variables were imputed to produce plots of the results from the model for an example patient by year of injury, age, time interval from injury to craniotomy, GCS, and ISS (Figs. 3 and 4).
SEMI	NEG	PMC5300032.xml	S121	DISCUSSION	NEG	Dent et al9 evaluated 211 patients, finding a strong trend toward reduced survival for patients with hematoma evacuated within 4 hours (P = 0.07).
SEMI	NEG	PMC5300032.xml	S123	DISCUSSION	NEG	A 2006 systematic review by Bullock et al2 found that most studies focusing on the time between injury and surgery did not show a correlation with outcome but also noted that “the relationship between time from injury to operation and outcome is difficult to study because patients who are operated on soon after TBI tend to have more severe injuries than those who undergo delayed surgery.”
SEMI	NEG	PMC5300032.xml	S125	DISCUSSION	NEG	The current study also presents 2498 cases, in excess of the maximum of 211 patients previously published on this topic.9
SEMI	NEG	PMC5300032.xml	S129	DISCUSSION	NEG	In light of the aging population, our results suggest that the age range of 45 to 70 years is a critical range with a significant reduction in the probability of survival above the age of 70.
SEMI	NEG	PMC5300032.xml	S131	DISCUSSION	NEG	Several studies in TBI literature have provided conflicting results of the effect of NSU direct admission.
SEMI	POS	PMC5300032.xml	S137	LIMITATIONS	POS	There are some limitations to the results presented here.
SEMI	POS	PMC5300032.xml	S138	LIMITATIONS	POS	Firstly, we defined an ASDH as a subdural hematoma requiring a craniotomy within 48 hours of the injury.
SEMI	POS	PMC5300032.xml	S139	LIMITATIONS	POS	Radiological diagnosis of ASDH was not available.
SEMI	POS	PMC5300032.xml	S140	LIMITATIONS	POS	Our results may have therefore excluded some cases.
SEMI	POS	PMC5300032.xml	S141	LIMITATIONS	POS	However, overall, we feel that the cut-off of 48 hours is reasonable, as this paper aimed to focus on the more severe end of the spectrum of ASDH following acute trauma.
SEMI	POS	PMC5300032.xml	S142	LIMITATIONS	POS	Secondly, the model did not adjust for comorbidities due to limited data in the TARN database in early years.
SEMI	POS	PMC5300032.xml	S143	LIMITATIONS	POS	However, as comorbidities are likely to be more prevalent with increasing age and the mean age increased over the study period, the improvement in risk-adjusted mortality over time may have been underestimated.
SEMI	POS	PMC5300032.xml	S144	LIMITATIONS	POS	Over the 20-year period, there was also a substantial increase in the number of hospitals covered in the TARN database.
SEMI	POS	PMC5300032.xml	S145	LIMITATIONS	POS	Sensitivity analysis of sites present throughout the 20-year period provided consistent results to the total cohort.
SEMI	POS	PMC5300032.xml	S146	LIMITATIONS	POS	Although the case mix of patients was controlled, their location and hence potential disparities in their management was not.
SEMI	POS	PMC5300032.xml	S147	LIMITATIONS	POS	However, none of the NSUs were outliers on TARN mortality monitoring over the time period studied.
SEMI	POS	PMC5300032.xml	S148	LIMITATIONS	POS	Furthermore, there was a substantial proportion of data with missing values as previously identified in Table 1.
SEMI	POS	PMC5300032.xml	S149	LIMITATIONS	POS	This is particularly pertinent for pupil reactivity, which was missing throughout the period 1994 to 2003.
SEMI	POS	PMC5300032.xml	S150	LIMITATIONS	POS	Where pupil reactivity data were missing but GCS was 14 or 15, we assumed that no significant brainstem compression/uncal herniation would exist and pupils were considered to be both reactive.
SEMI	POS	PMC5300032.xml	S151	LIMITATIONS	POS	This way, the number of missing pupils was further reduced.
SEMI	POS	PMC5300032.xml	S152	LIMITATIONS	POS	Multiple imputation was then applied in the updated dataset, with statistical methods employed to minimize the potential risk to internal validity.33
SEMI	POS	PMC5300032.xml	S153	LIMITATIONS	POS	Finally, the available data do not allow us to investigate the role of primary decompressive craniectomy in the management of ASDH.34
SEMI	POS	PMC5300032.xml	S154	LIMITATIONS	POS	This is clearly an important aspect of surgical management and will hopefully be answered by an ongoing randomized trial (RESCUE-ASDH).35
SEMI	NEG	PMC5300771.xml	S3	Importance	NEG	Bacteriuria plus pyuria is highly prevalent among older women living in nursing homes.

SEMI	NEG	PMC5300904.xml	S53		NEG	These results show that the observed phenotypes are unlikely to be caused by unspecific effects of amiRNAs and indicate that the sequence-specific inhibition of selected islet lncRNAs can result in transcriptional changes comparable in magnitude to the inhibition of well-established islet transcriptional regulators.
SEMI	NEG	PMC5300904.xml	S73		NEG	Likewise, genes associated with enhancer clusters and those showing islet-specific expression were also enriched among genes that were downregulated after knockdown of HI-LNC12, 15, 30, 78, 80, 85, and 71 (Figure 4; Figures S4A and S4B).
SEMI	NEG	PMC5300904.xml	S146		NEG	We thus propose that PLUTO regulates the 3D architecture of the enhancer cluster at the PDX1 locus.

SEMI	NEG	PMC5301440.xml	S29	Background	NEG	This has led to the framework of both the 10th and draft 11th revisions of ICD (ICD-10 2010 version and ICD-11 beta draft as at May 2014 respectively) to be deficient in capturing the concepts currently in use for allergic and hypersensitivity conditions [7].
SEMI	NEG	PMC5301440.xml	S70	Results	NEG	The ICD-11 content model incorporates: title, definition, synonyms, narrower terms, exclusions, body system, body site, signs and symptoms, causal agents and causal mechanisms [10].
SEMI	NEG	PMC5301440.xml	S78	Results	NEG	As explained above the ICD-11 Foundation is a polyhierarchical construct.
SEMI	NEG	PMC5307820.xml	S23	Background	NEG	Smoking is also the primary risk factor for chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) [4], projected to be the third leading global cause of death by 2030 [5].

SEMI	NEG	PMC5307820.xml	S89	Methods	NEG	5 μm sections were made from lung tissue.
SEMI	NEG	PMC5307820.xml	S188	Discussion	NEG	Repetitive instillation of MAA adduct in mouse lung resulted in inflammation as a result of neutrophil influx in the peri-bronchial region.
SEMI	NEG	PMC5312978.xml	S11	Abstract	NEG	On the eighth day after birth, because of the aggravation of heart failure, emergency surgery for excision of umbilical AVM was performed.
SEMI	NEG	PMC5312978.xml	S35	Case report	NEG	Eight days after the birth, emergency surgery was performed because a sign of right heart failure appeared in the cardiac echography.
SEMI	NEG	PMC5312978.xml	S52	Discussion	NEG	Umbilical AVM can also be related to heart failure.[3,4]
SEMI	NEG	PMC5312978.xml	S58	Discussion	NEG	However, there is no case report that presented liver failure after surgical removal of an umbilical AVM.

SEMI	NEG	PMC5312979.xml	S58	Case reports	NEG	On the following day, the patient complained of worsening abdominal distension and dyspnea.
SEMI	NEG	PMC5312979.xml	S88	Case reports	NEG	Abdominal CT revealed a perihepatic fluid collection of an area of 13 × 3 cm suspected of biloma that possibly occurred during PVE, and a large quantity of pleural effusion in the right lung base (Fig. 2D).
SEMI	NEG	PMC5312979.xml	S107	Discussion	NEG	Case 2 patient showed clear symptom improvement for a while after infected bile and right pleural effusion was drained.

SEMI	POS	PMC5312980.xml	S102	Discussion	POS	Failure to establish an accurate diagnosis may be because of sampling error.
SEMI	POS	PMC5312980.xml	S103	Discussion	POS	In these circumstances, repeat aspiration is suggested, and excisional biopsy may be considered.[19]
SEMI	POS	PMC5312980.xml	S104	Discussion	POS	This study has focused on spectrum of FNA in pediatrics.
SEMI	POS	PMC5312980.xml	S105	Discussion	POS	There are many papers on accuracy, sensitivity, and specificity which already confirmed FNA as useful.[20–23]
SEMI	NEG	PMC5312980.xml	S108	Discussion	NEG	Regardless the gender, the mean age of children receiving a malignant diagnosis was significantly higher than that of benign lesions.
SEMI	NEG	PMC5312981.xml	S56		NEG	Low-dose CT acquisition was performed first, without any breath-holding instructions.
SEMI	NEG	PMC5312981.xml	S77		NEG	Statistical analysis was performed using t test.
SEMI	NEG	PMC5312981.xml	S126		NEG	The remarkable response to therapy observed in our patient could be explained by the efficacy of the multitarget approach in blocking cell proliferation via the synergistic inhibition of ERK1/2 by foscarnet, LMWH and sunitinib, and cell migration via the sunitinib-dependent Akt modulation and LMWH activity.

SEMI	NEG	PMC5312984.xml	S68	Surgical technique	NEG	The duodeno-bladder drainage was performed by inserting an EEA circular stapler (Covidien, Mansfield, MA) via the fourth portion of the duodenum.
SEMI	NEG	PMC5312984.xml	S103	Discussion	NEG	Another consideration is that obese recipients of kidney or liver transplantation were reported to have significantly better outcomes compared to patients remaining on transplant wait lists.[23]
SEMI	NEG	PMC5312984.xml	S127	Discussion	NEG	We considered that the upper midline incision carried the lowest risk for infection and may not be replaced by a Pfannestiel incision, as this would embed the incision in the moist panniculus of obese patients that subsequently increases risk of surgical site infection.
SEMI	NEG	PMC5312985.xml	S49	Methods	NEG	The outcome of interest was defined by participants’ answers to survey questions related to self-assessed experience with symptoms of PPD.

SEMI	NEG	PMC5313002.xml	S194	Discussion	NEG	One unexplored avenue is that HIIT participants may self-select higher levels of physical activity out-with the HIIT intervention which has been demonstrated in adolescents,[23] but remains to be examined in adult and ageing populations.
SEMI	NEG	PMC5313002.xml	S204	Discussion	NEG	In the present study, muscle hypertrophy was not directly measured, but clearly cannot be ruled out as a contributor to increased LBM.
SEMI	POS	PMC5313002.xml	S231	Discussion	POS	The present study has some important limitations that should be noted.
SEMI	POS	PMC5313002.xml	S232	Discussion	POS	One concerns the proximity (11 days) of the conditioning exercise (training block 1) to the LfHIIT intervention (training block 2), which makes it impossible to rule out the contribution of conditioning exercise to the overall effect on INT after LfHIIT.
SEMI	POS	PMC5313002.xml	S233	Discussion	POS	However, given the randomized controlled design and the lack of difference between groups at phase B, the difference in PPO evident at phase C is almost certainly due to the LfHIIT intervention.
SEMI	POS	PMC5313002.xml	S234	Discussion	POS	As the effects of high-intensity exercise are unstudied in older cohorts, the inclusion of the conditioning exercise during phase A was deemed a prudent means of gradually introducing the previously inactive INT cohort to the rigors of high-intensity training.
SEMI	POS	PMC5313002.xml	S235	Discussion	POS	This decision appears justified as there was complete adherence to the LfHIIT after conditioning.
SEMI	POS	PMC5313002.xml	S236	Discussion	POS	Similarly, the ACSM has recently indicated that conditioning training should be employed before undertaking high-intensity interval training.[37]
SEMI	POS	PMC5313002.xml	S237	Discussion	POS	In conclusion, the novel findings of the present study are that LfHIIT is both feasible and effective as a training modality to increase lower limb muscle power in sedentary ageing men.
SEMI	POS	PMC5313002.xml	S238	Discussion	POS	However, when performed using stationary cycle ergometry, it does not improve balance in otherwise healthy sedentary ageing males.
SEMI	POS	PMC5313002.xml	S239	Discussion	POS	This study provides strong supporting evidence for the inclusion of LfHIIT when prescribing exercise to improve lower-limb power in ageing cohorts.

SEMI	NEG	PMC5313003.xml	S52	Materials and methods	NEG	In the preliminary analysis, we used phylogenetic inference to identify time points with evidence of HIV-1C super-infection based on branching patterns and presence of phylogenetically distinct clusters separated by other participants’ sequences.
SEMI	NEG	PMC5313003.xml	S54	Materials and methods	NEG	In addition, 15 time points were excluded due to the initiation of ART.
SEMI	NEG	PMC5313003.xml	S93	Materials and methods	NEG	We used a linear mixed-effects model to assess the association between estimated time since infection and tMRCA or raw pairwise distances, taking into account the intrahost dependency of repeated measurements.
SEMI	NEG	PMC5313003.xml	S111	Results	NEG	We calculated the sensitivity and specificity of using pairwise distances or tMCRA to predict time since infection within 130, 180, and 360 days (Table 2).
SEMI	NEG	PMC5313003.xml	S121	Discussion	NEG	Therefore, pairwise distances can be used as a marker of HIV recency for infections with a single transmitted virus.
SEMI	NEG	PMC5313003.xml	S127	Discussion	NEG	Both markers, tMRCA and pairwise distances, are significantly associated with time from HIV infection, suggesting the potential utility of intrahost virus sequences for HIV recency estimation in cross-sectional sampling.
SEMI	POS	PMC5313003.xml	S131	Discussion	POS	We used the available set of intrahost HIV-1C env sequences, which does not necessarily adequately represent the distribution of HIV-1C viruses on a population level.
SEMI	POS	PMC5313003.xml	S132	Discussion	POS	All specimens were collected in 2004 to 2010, and therefore might not reflect the current HIV epidemic in Southern Africa, as circulating viruses could differ over time.
SEMI	POS	PMC5313003.xml	S133	Discussion	POS	The sample set was enriched with early time points, with a relatively small number of later time points.
SEMI	POS	PMC5313003.xml	S134	Discussion	POS	To avoid over-parameterization, we used a relatively simple evolutionary model and simplistic parameters for the estimation of tMRCA, which is another study limitation.
SEMI	POS	PMC5313003.xml	S135	Discussion	POS	To optimize parameters in the Bayesian Evolutionary Analysis by Sampling Trees analysis for a more accurate estimation of tMRCA, further studies are warranted.
SEMI	POS	PMC5313003.xml	S136	Discussion	POS	Our preliminary data suggest that each pool of viral quasispecies might require individual optimization of parameters and model selection.
SEMI	POS	PMC5313003.xml	S137	Discussion	POS	In a limited set of preliminary runs, we found that applying more complex models to a pool of viral quasispecies with low level of viral diversity results in poor convergence and unstable behavior of the MCMC run, which is likely to represent a negative effect of over-parameterization.[49–51]
SEMI	POS	PMC5313003.xml	S138	Discussion	POS	It is also possible that using virus sequences representing multiple time points of sampling (if available) could improve the estimation of tMRCA, as described by Poon et al.[25]

SEMI	NEG	PMC5313013.xml	S61	Discussion	NEG	Dome-and-dart T waves have not been reported to be previously associated with hyperthyroidism, which frequently, however, involves atrial fibrillation, premature beats, or cardiac dilatation after long-term exposure to high thyroid hormone levels.
SEMI	NEG	PMC5313014.xml	S20	Abstract	NEG	Pancreatic neuroendocrine tumors (pNET) are rare slowly growing tumors with a high metastatic potential.
SEMI	NEG	PMC5313014.xml	S27	Introduction	NEG	The latter are poorly differentiated tumors for which chemotherapy is indicated as a first-line therapeutic option.

SEMI	NEG	PMC5313017.xml	S129	Discussion	NEG	Both in-time evaluation and the initiation of ECMO support require a coordinated approach among trauma specialists and cardiovascular surgeons.
SEMI	POS	PMC5313017.xml	S168	Discussion	POS	Despite the promising results of the present study, several important limitations must be considered.
SEMI	POS	PMC5313017.xml	S169	Discussion	POS	First, the study used a retrospective and nonrandomized control design with very small sample size; bias might exist influencing the homogeneity of the mortality and survivor groups.
SEMI	POS	PMC5313017.xml	S170	Discussion	POS	Second, the decision regarding ECMO consultations was made by individual physicians, without consensus or protocol agreement.
SEMI	POS	PMC5313017.xml	S171	Discussion	POS	A different threshold for ECMO support and ventilator strategies might have also affected the final outcomes.
SEMI	POS	PMC5313017.xml	S172	Discussion	POS	Finally, as a retrospective study, some hemodynamic data, laboratory profiles, and inotropic medication dosage information were not completely analyzed because of missing or incomplete records.
SEMI	POS	PMC5313017.xml	S173	Discussion	POS	This hindered more detailed analyses of physiological fluctuations during ECMO support.
SEMI	NEG	PMC5313017.xml	S178	Conclusions	NEG	The early deployment of ECMO (before irreversible organ damage), judicious heparin titration therapy, and aggressive correction of associated injuries are key to the final success.
SEMI	NEG	PMC5313018.xml	S39		NEG	The K value, derived from the difference in mean echo intensity (MEI) between the involved and uninvolved muscle in every examination under the same ultrasound setting, reflects the severity of fibrosis in affected muscles.[6]

SEMI	POS	PMC5313018.xml	S161		POS	Muscle histopathological results were not available, because no subjects in the study underwent surgical intervention.
SEMI	POS	PMC5313018.xml	S162		POS	Therefore, it is hard to differentiate the effects of maturation, therapy, or growth on involved muscle in the study.
SEMI	NEG	PMC5313019.xml	S70	Material and methods	NEG	The real-time allelic discrimination assay, which was based on the 5 prime nuclease activity of Taq polymerase, was performed in a total volume of 50 μL containing 3 μL of the genomic DNA template, 1 U of Taqpolymerase (Finnzymes), 20 pmol of each primer (TIBMOLBIOL), 2 pmol of each probe (IDT DNA, Coralville, IA),10 nmol of each dNTP (Fermentas), and 2% dimethyl sulfoxide (Sigma, St.
SEMI	NEG	PMC5313019.xml	S137	Discussion	NEG	Additionally, we could not support an association between liver cirrhosis and heterozygous Z alleles such as (MZ and SZ), because there were no alleles except for MM, MS, and SS variants in the healthy controls, which may have arose due the small number of available subjects in the kingdom.
SEMI	NEG	PMC5313019.xml	S142	Discussion	NEG	Thus, individuals with no S or Z variants and low AAT concentrations need phenotyping to acquire a definitive diagnosis due to this limitation of genotyping.
SEMI	NEG	PMC5313019.xml	S178	Discussion	NEG	This trend clearly appeared in our research because the mean age of patients with liver cirrhosis was 62.47 ± 8.8 for men and was 69.42 ± 6.6 for women.
SEMI	NEG	PMC5313020.xml	S8	Abstract	NEG	The decreasing FA rate on the affected sides of patients correlated negatively with the increasing ADC rate (r = −0.675, P = 0.000).

SEMI	NEG	PMC5313026.xml	S10	Abstract	NEG	The ANN models were developed on Matlab 7.1.
SEMI	NEG	PMC5313026.xml	S75	Materials and methods	NEG	Information about exposure to environmental risk factors was collected using the questions with the answer “yes or no.” The exposure time of maternal risks was defined as from “6 months before conception” to “the first trimester of pregnancy,” while the exposure time of paternal risks was 6 months before conception.
SEMI	NEG	PMC5313026.xml	S97	Materials and methods	NEG	A standard feed-forward back-propagation neural network (BPNN) was applied due to its relative simplicity and stability.[17,18]
SEMI	NEG	PMC5313026.xml	S98	Materials and methods	NEG	In general, a BPNN consists of 3 layers: an input layer that receives information, a hidden layer that processes information, and an output layer that calculates results.[19]
SEMI	NEG	PMC5313026.xml	S124	Results	NEG	Eight subjects with missing data >20% were excluded from the study.
SEMI	NEG	PMC5313026.xml	S138	Results	NEG	The occurrence of CHD is inversely related to 4 protective factors, including high education level (OR = 0.55), intake of vegetable/fruit (0.45), intake of fish/shrimp/meat/egg (0.59), and intake of milk/soymilk (0.55).
SEMI	NEG	PMC5313026.xml	S144	Results	NEG	The BPNN models each consist of an input layer, a hidden layer, and an output layer.
SEMI	NEG	PMC5313026.xml	S167	Discussion	NEG	With logistic regression and based on maternal demographic factors (maternal age, race, education, marital status, parity, prenatal care initiations, and smoking), Tan et al[6] built preterm birth models for prediction of singleton, twin, and triplet pregnancies, and got the sensitivity of 0.25, 0.65, and 0.64, respectively, and the specificity of 0.94, 0.57, and 0.54, respectively.
SEMI	NEG	PMC5313026.xml	S179	Discussion	NEG	For example, by applying presumed data, women of childbearing age could estimate the CHD risk of their future babies.
SEMI	NEG	PMC5313026.xml	S189	Discussion	NEG	The BPNN model developed here has high specificity but relatively low sensitivity.
SEMI	NEG	PMC5313026.xml	S196	Discussion	NEG	Therefore, further large-sample-size research is needed to identify the specific predictors of CHD (e.g., CHD-associated biological markers or genes) and to improve the model sensitivity.
SEMI	POS	PMC5313026.xml	S197	Discussion	POS	This study has several limitations.
SEMI	POS	PMC5313026.xml	S198	Discussion	POS	First, we developed the BPNN model using epidemiological data, mainly including family history and environmental factors, but did not consider relevant laboratory data such as biochemical indicators and genetic factors (CHD-associated genes).
SEMI	POS	PMC5313026.xml	S199	Discussion	POS	The epidemiological data was collected using a case-control study, which was a retrospective observational study and susceptible to bias.
SEMI	POS	PMC5313026.xml	S200	Discussion	POS	The CHD cases and controls were only a sample of the source population, so there might be potential selection bias, which could be seen as 1 “incoherence” of the cases and controls with respect to the corresponding population at risk.[38]
SEMI	POS	PMC5313026.xml	S201	Discussion	POS	The method of data collection in our study was based on self-report by the subjects (recall of past events), which inevitably led to recall bias in the data.
SEMI	POS	PMC5313026.xml	S202	Discussion	POS	In addition, measurement bias might also exist in the CHD case ascertainment.
SEMI	POS	PMC5313026.xml	S203	Discussion	POS	Second, most of factors measured were dichotomous variables rather than continuous variables, without considering dose response relationship between exposure levels of these risk factors and CHD, which may hide their true relationships with CHD.
SEMI	POS	PMC5313026.xml	S204	Discussion	POS	Third, the training and testing samples were all from the same population.
SEMI	POS	PMC5313026.xml	S205	Discussion	POS	The predictive performance of the new model was not validated in other populations, and its generalizability could not be correctly determined.
SEMI	POS	PMC5313026.xml	S206	Discussion	POS	Fourth, the model could not be expressed by specific equations due to the complexity of ANN and the weak explanatory of their weights.
SEMI	POS	PMC5313026.xml	S207	Discussion	POS	The application of this model was not as simple and convenient as nomogram models for the clinicians,[39] since it relies on a computer and a specific program.
SEMI	NEG	PMC5313027.xml	S27	Introduction	NEG	Due to the reliance on contrast agents in PWI, noninvasive alternatives remain an unmet need.
SEMI	NEG	PMC5313027.xml	S28	Introduction	NEG	SWI is capable of providing additional clinical information complementary to conventional magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) sequences.
SEMI	NEG	PMC5313027.xml	S48	Case report	NEG	The DWI-SWI mismatch was comparable to that of DWI-PWI, suggesting that DWI-SWI could predict ischemic penumbra in patient with acute infarction.
SEMI	NEG	PMC5313027.xml	S65	Discussion	NEG	The reason might be that MTT detects more ill-perfused areas than SWI, especially in good collateralized subjects.[10]
SEMI	NEG	PMC5313028.xml	S8	Abstract	NEG	A 14-year-old girl was admitted in our hospital with intermittent right upper quadrant pain for 1 month and recent (1 day) progressive deterioration.

SEMI	NEG	PMC5313031.xml	S56	Methods	NEG	Primary endpoint analyzed was SVR12, defined as undetectable HCV RNA polymerase chain reaction (PCR) (<43 IU/mL) 12 weeks following the end of treatment.
SEMI	NEG	PMC5313031.xml	S62	Methods	NEG	This study was approved by the Administrative Panel for Human Subjects at Stanford University.
SEMI	NEG	PMC5313032.xml	S29	Introduction	NEG	We aimed to compare the time course during surgery in SPI values between patients receiving nicardipine infusion and those receiving remifentanil infusion during thyroidectomy under general anesthesia.
SEMI	NEG	PMC5313032.xml	S85	Materials and methods	NEG	A P-value <0.05 was considered statistically significant.
SEMI	NEG	PMC5313032.xml	S103	Discussion	NEG	However, SPI values may also be affected by other factors, including the type of anesthesia,[10] age[18] or positioning of the patient,[8] fingertip temperature, intravascular volume status,[9] prescribed hypertensive drugs,[1] and the concomitant use of cardiovascular drugs such as esmolol or labetalol during surgery.[6,11]
SEMI	NEG	PMC5313032.xml	S134	Discussion	NEG	White et al[26] reported that the intraoperative use of esmolol and nicardipine infusion as an adjuvant to desflurane and nitrous oxide during laparoscopic surgery decreased postoperative opioid analgesic requirements.
SEMI	NEG	PMC5314135.xml	S33	Methods	NEG	In discovery samples that passed quality control procedures, we performed individual tests for association of the selected variants with CAD in each study separately, using logistic regression analysis with principal components of ancestry as covariates (5).
SEMI	NEG	PMC5314135.xml	S73	Results	NEG	The lead variant, rs11172113, is in intron 1 of LRP1 (LDL receptor–related protein-1) and only has 1 other adjacent SNP in high LD (Central Illustration, Online Table 4).
SEMI	NEG	PMC5314135.xml	S76	Results	NEG	The lead variant overlaps a region containing peaks in deoxyribonuclease I hypersensitivity in several cells and tissues, including aortic smooth muscle cells, within a predicted enhancer element (Online Figure 3).
SEMI	NEG	PMC5314135.xml	S93	Results	NEG	There is extended linkage at this locus, with more than 100 SNPs in high LD and the lead variant in a region of ∼170 kb also spanning GIGYF2 (GRB10 interacting GYF protein 2) (Online Figure 3).
SEMI	NEG	PMC5314135.xml	S99	Results	NEG	The full results are shown in Online Table 6, and the significant associations are summarized in Table 2.
SEMI	NEG	PMC5314135.xml	S102	Results	NEG	Most associations were in the direction consistent from the epidemiological association of these risk factors with CAD, although a few displayed effects in the opposite direction (the risk variants at 2q33 and 12q24 are associated with reduced plasma LDL cholesterol, and those at 10q24, 12q24, and 19q13 are associated with lower BMI).
SEMI	NEG	PMC5314135.xml	S107	Results	NEG	When restricted to variants with a high LD (r2 > 0.8) with the lead CAD variant, 29 of 62 (47%) loci showed an association with another disease/trait at a p value <1 × 10−4.
SEMI	POS	PMC5314135.xml	S155	Discussion	POS	First, in our discovery study, we were only able to interrogate common variants associated with other diseases and traits that were known at the time of the creation of the exome array in late 2011 and, thus, included on the array.
SEMI	POS	PMC5314135.xml	S156	Discussion	POS	Conversely, our interrogation for pleiotropic associations of the new and known CAD has used the latest data available in the GWAS catalogs and other sources.
SEMI	POS	PMC5314135.xml	S157	Discussion	POS	Second, the common variants tested in our study conferred statistically robust yet quantitatively modest effects on both CAD and potentially related traits.
SEMI	POS	PMC5314135.xml	S158	Discussion	POS	Thus, we may have missed associations with other traits.
SEMI	POS	PMC5314135.xml	S159	Discussion	POS	However, if such traits were considered as intermediary steps in the etiology of CAD, exploration of our large GWAS sample sets and respective GWAS catalogs should have detected relevant associations.
SEMI	POS	PMC5314135.xml	S160	Discussion	POS	Third, our discovery analysis is largely on the basis of subjects with Western-European ancestry, and any association with CAD of the new loci in other populations needs further evaluation.
SEMI	POS	PMC5314135.xml	S161	Discussion	POS	Finally, although we used relatively stringent criteria (minimal r2 > 0.8 between the CAD SNP and the lead variant associated with the other disease/trait), the limited content of the exome array and the information available in the GWAS catalogs meant that we could not examine the extent of overlap in the loci in detail.
SEMI	NEG	PMC5314136.xml	S46	Methods	NEG	Upon thawing, peptide standards were spiked into the samples (PlasmaDive kits, Biognosys AG, Schlieren, Switzerland).
SEMI	NEG	PMC5314136.xml	S144	Discussion	NEG	Furthermore, genome-wide association and Mendelian randomization studies suggest that loss-of-function mutations of apoC-III confer cardiovascular protection 12, 13, 24, 25.
SEMI	NEG	PMC5314136.xml	S149	Discussion	NEG	Antisense therapy that inhibits hepatic apoC-III synthesis results in effective reductions in plasma apoC-III and TG levels.
SEMI	POS	PMC5314136.xml	S182	Discussion	POS	Weaknesses of this study include that the many correlated tests presented herein were not adjusted for multiplicity, although key results would resist such adjustment, and that use of statins may weaken the association of VLDL- and LDL-associated apolipoproteins with regard to CVD risk; however, <10% of participants in the Bruneck study were on statin therapy, and exclusion of subjects on statin therapy yielded similar results (Online Figure 3).
SEMI	POS	PMC5314136.xml	S183	Discussion	POS	Future studies could extend the present study by measuring apolipoproteins within lipoprotein subfractions.
SEMI	POS	PMC5314136.xml	S184	Discussion	POS	Our findings of strong associations with apolipoproteins, such as apoL-I and apoH, for which published data are lacking, should be considered hypothesis-generating and deserving of further study.
SEMI	NEG	PMC5319114.xml	S3	Background	NEG	Periostin is a biomarker indicating the presence of type 2 inflammation and submucosal fibrosis; serum periostin levels have been associated with asthma severity.

SEMI	POS	PMC5319491.xml	S90		POS	However, this concern is mitigated by the large sample size, increasing the probability of inclusion of diverse dietary behaviors.
SEMI	POS	PMC5319491.xml	S91		POS	Moreover, we did not control for chronic diseases that might elevate hs-CRP.
SEMI	NEG	PMC5319492.xml	S27	Introduction	NEG	Transfusions can carry the risks of immunological reactions, transfusion-associated circulatory overload, transfusion-related acute renal failure, and even death.[5,6]
SEMI	NEG	PMC5319492.xml	S66	Materials and methods	NEG	Patients received transfusions if their Hb level was <80 g/L or if they experienced symptoms of anemia (such as mental status changes or palpitations) as determined by the senior orthopedic surgeon.
SEMI	NEG	PMC5319492.xml	S127	Discussion	NEG	Several studies[8–10] mentioned postoperative wound-related complications, such as wound infection, wound ooze, skin edge necrosis, inflamed wounds, and blistering.
SEMI	NEG	PMC5319492.xml	S131	Discussion	NEG	Although the wound ooze in the clamping group was slightly more than that in the nonclamping group, no statistically significant differences were observed between the 2 groups.
SEMI	NEG	PMC5319493.xml	S7	Abstract	NEG	We present a case of a 74-year-old male patient having massive ascites and bilateral lower leg edema.
SEMI	NEG	PMC5319493.xml	S50	Discussion	NEG	More than 90% of bladder cancers are urothelial carcinomas.

SEMI	NEG	PMC5319494.xml	S136	Results	NEG	Moreover, the eradication rate was significantly affected by levofloxacin resistance in EBLA (92.3% vs 61.1%, χ2 = 8.29, P = 0.010) or ELA (90.9% vs 66.7%, χ2 = 5.8, P = 0.040), as shown in Table 5.
SEMI	NEG	PMC5319494.xml	S171	Discussion	NEG	In China, resistance rates to clarithromycin, metronidazole, and levofloxacin were 21.5, 95.4, and 20.6%, respectively,[33] which are similar to our study.
SEMI	NEG	PMC5319495.xml	S88	Results	NEG	Additionally, ASL-acquired data from 1 HIV-infected participant and 3 healthy controls were excluded due to motion artifacts (n = 2) and labeling artifacts (n = 2).
SEMI	NEG	PMC5319495.xml	S107	Results	NEG	No associations were found between CBF and cognitive performance in HIV-infected children (Table 6).
SEMI	NEG	PMC5319495.xml	S120	Discussion	NEG	The first, acute phase is characterized by increased CBF and concentrations of choline and myo-inositol,[29,30] indicative of glial proliferation, and the second, chronic phase is clinically marked by more severe psychomotor decline, along with decreased CBF,[29] volume loss,[12] and lower N-acetylaspartate concentrations,[30] likely due to cell death.
SEMI	NEG	PMC5319495.xml	S141	Discussion	NEG	A study focusing on patients with MS, a disorder characterized by CNS inflammation and macro- and microstructural WM injury, reported higher CBF in normal appearing WM in association with increased inflammatory activity in the brain.[37]
SEMI	NEG	PMC5319496.xml	S37		NEG	All instruments were self-administered by patients prior to initiation of any study-related activities at baseline (day 1) visit, treatment week 12, and at post-treatment weeks 4, 12, and 24 while blinded to their most recent HCV RNA levels.
SEMI	NEG	PMC5319496.xml	S41		NEG	The 2011 US population norms were used for normalization.[15]
SEMI	NEG	PMC5319496.xml	S60		NEG	In a separate round of analysis, independent predictors of summary PROs and SF-6D utility scores were assessed at the study time points separately using multiple linear regressions with stepwise selection of predictors; only predictors with P < 0.05 were left in the final regression models.
SEMI	NEG	PMC5319496.xml	S115		NEG	Although HCV patients who were treatment-experienced with IFN had higher baseline PRO scores, most of these were likely due to previously applied strict treatment eligibility criteria.
SEMI	NEG	PMC5319497.xml	S27		NEG	Other challenges include lack of understanding of sex differences in pain expression and perception.[16–18]
SEMI	NEG	PMC5319497.xml	S38		NEG	The Neurology Service of the Toronto Rehab-University Health Network has an exclusive province-wide agreement with the Workers’ Safety and Insurance Board (WSIB) to provide expert diagnostic opinions about persons who have sustained head injuries at work and who continue to experience persistent symptoms when maximal physical healing has occurred.
SEMI	NEG	PMC5319497.xml	S82		NEG	We ensured a higher number of SPV in all our models.
SEMI	NEG	PMC5319497.xml	S121		NEG	Male participants who sustained concussion/mTBI by being caught, crushed, pinched, or by jumping by/between object(s) had significantly lower pain total scores (6.75 ± 3.18 vs 16.67 ± 6.05, P = 0.026) than those injured in other ways.
SEMI	NEG	PMC5319497.xml	S138		NEG	We did not observe VIF > 4 for any covariate, suggesting that collinearity did not contribute to the change in regression estimates.
SEMI	NEG	PMC5319497.xml	S159		NEG	Our results are consistent with previous discoveries on the topic of chronic pain, suggesting that the emotional state of mind (or situation or experience) is related to the perception of pain,[38–40] and that poor sleep may be a mediator in the relationship between depression and pain.
SEMI	NEG	PMC5319497.xml	S160		NEG	Our results go along with the concept of pain proposed by the ancient Greeks, who considered chronic pain to be the opposite of pleasure, viewing it as an emotion.[1,41]
SEMI	NEG	PMC5319497.xml	S176		NEG	English as a first language was associated with less severe pain in males but not in females.
SEMI	NEG	PMC5319497.xml	S178		NEG	Our bivariate analyses identified an association between pain and occupation; laborers experience more significant pain than other occupations, although this relationship disappears when sociodemographic and other occupational variables are incorporated into the model.
SEMI	NEG	PMC5319497.xml	S181		NEG	This is particularly relevant in major urban centers in Canada, given its linguistic diversity and growing prevalence of newcomers entering the workforce with languages other than English.[53,54]
SEMI	NEG	PMC5319497.xml	S196		NEG	Sex as a risk factor for specific sleep disorders in mTBI has gained significant recent attention in the clinical and research communities.[62,63]
SEMI	NEG	PMC5319497.xml	S204		NEG	Likewise, daytime sleepiness was an independent covariate of chronic pain in females, but not in males.
SEMI	NEG	PMC5319497.xml	S215		NEG	The benefit of this approach lies in identifying previously undescribed associations for further study.
SEMI	POS	PMC5319497.xml	S226		POS	In light of the number of a priori-hypothesized variables potentially associated with our outcome of interest, the unknown hierarchy between variables in the construct of chronic pain – and due to the fact that only the stepwise multiple regressions allowed us to evaluate the order of importance of variables in the individual modeling process – our research team collectively agreed that, despite the potential limitations (ie, the fit may appear to be better than it is, model simplification, etc.), stepwise multiple regression was the most suitable approach.
SEMI	POS	PMC5319497.xml	S227		POS	We used a Visual Analogue Scale for pain assessment.[74]
SEMI	POS	PMC5319497.xml	S228		POS	This method is particularly valuable because it captures the unpleasantness of the pain experience, is sensitive to interventions that alter pain experience, and correlates well with other numeric and verbal rating scales.[75]
SEMI	POS	PMC5319497.xml	S229		POS	It has been reported, however, that the visual analogue scale primarily measures pain affect and may not adequately capture the complexity of pain phenomena, particularly sensory and overall intensity domains.[76]
SEMI	POS	PMC5319497.xml	S230		POS	We attempted to mitigate this by capturing the sensory location of pain, namely head, neck, or bodily pain.
SEMI	POS	PMC5319497.xml	S231		POS	Our statistical analyses used continuous numeric values of the intensity of pain, encompassing current, best, and worst pain.
SEMI	POS	PMC5319497.xml	S232		POS	We sought to distinguish covariates of perceived pain by collecting a variety of data related to the hypothesized relationships, using standardized scales and paying attention to specific items within them.
SEMI	POS	PMC5319497.xml	S233		POS	Nevertheless, it remains unclear how well the P-VAS reflects the multidimensionality of the construct under study.
SEMI	POS	PMC5319497.xml	S234		POS	We evaluated the internal consistency of the measure, and the results indicated that its use was appropriate.
SEMI	POS	PMC5319497.xml	S235		POS	Nonresponse bias did not occur.
SEMI	POS	PMC5319497.xml	S236		POS	Self-validity of PR outcome data were ensured in our bivariate and multivariate modeling analyses by controlling for intentional production of false exaggerated physical or psychological symptoms (ie, DSM-IV-TR diagnoses of malingering) and cognitive disorder, as determined by the neurology services team.
SEMI	POS	PMC5319497.xml	S237		POS	The present study highlights factors associated with the perceptual state of pain at the moment of investigation (a cross-sectional relationship), though the longitudinal relationships remain to be determined.
SEMI	POS	PMC5319497.xml	S238		POS	Finally, we explored the construct of chronic pain through biological (ie, sex) lens; factors associated with gender (socialized toughness in men, etc.) may also be involved, but were not explored.
SEMI	NEG	PMC5319498.xml	S81	Results	NEG	Further, the MIU culture was nonmotile, indole positive, and urinary enzyme negative.
SEMI	NEG	PMC5319498.xml	S113	Results	NEG	A total of 7 strains containing cas1 (b), including 2 strains of E coli and 5 strains of Shigella (4–1, 6, 9, 22, and 25–2), showed a similarity >90%.
SEMI	NEG	PMC5319498.xml	S119	Results	NEG	A total of 11 strains containing cas2, including 3 strains of E coli and 8 strains of Shigella (4–1, 6, 7, 9, 12, 13–2, 22, and 25–2), showed similarity >90%.
SEMI	NEG	PMC5319498.xml	S135	Discussion	NEG	The CRISPR sequences in Shigella and E coli are homologous, but still show some differences, which may be due to the transfer of the CRISPR sequence from E coli to Shigella.
SEMI	NEG	PMC5319499.xml	S11	Abstract	NEG	Computed tomographic (CT) angiography showed the presence of large bilateral CIAAs (right CIA = 66 mm; left CIA = 38 mm), without concomitant thoracic or abdominal aorta aneurysm.
SEMI	NEG	PMC5319499.xml	S27	Introduction	NEG	To address these issues, several endovascular strategies have been proposed to preserve at least 1 internal iliac artery, including the Bell Bottom technique,[9,10] Chimney technique,[11] Sandwich technique,[12] and Parallel Endograft technique.[13]
SEMI	NEG	PMC5319499.xml	S40	Case presentation	NEG	Computed tomographic (CT) angiography demonstrated the presence of a large bilateral CIAAs (right CIA = 66 mm; left CIA = 38 mm) (Fig. 1A).
SEMI	NEG	PMC5319499.xml	S74	Discussion	NEG	Karthikesalingam et al[16] and Gray et al[18] reported that only one third of patients with aorto-iliac or isolated CIA aneurysms fulfilled the criteria for the use of these endovascular devices.
SEMI	NEG	PMC5319500.xml	S18	Abstract	NEG	At the time of diagnosis, the AST were 350 ± 448 U/L, ALT 247 ± 190 U/L, bilirubin 7 ± 12 mg/dL, and alkaline phosphatase 126 ± 53 U/L.
SEMI	NEG	PMC5319500.xml	S28	Introduction	NEG	Other etiologies of liver disease such as alpha-1-antitrpsysin deficiency, Wilson disease, hemochromatosis, viral hepatitis, drug-induced liver injury, and alcoholic/nonalcoholic liver disease also warrant exclusion.
SEMI	NEG	PMC5319500.xml	S53	Results	NEG	Figure 1 shows representative histology from 3 of the 4 patients.
SEMI	NEG	PMC5319500.xml	S61	Results	NEG	No adverse events were noted related to their HIV.
SEMI	NEG	PMC5319501.xml	S38	Methods	NEG	Vancomycin was routinely administered by continuous intravenous infusion via an electrical pump connected to a dedicated central venous catheter.
SEMI	NEG	PMC5319501.xml	S56	Methods	NEG	We also recorded the peak serum creatinine level between vancomycin initiation and 72 hours after vancomycin discontinuation, and we computed the serum creatinine increase from baseline to this peak (expressed as the absolute value and percentage).
SEMI	NEG	PMC5319501.xml	S107	Results	NEG	By univariate analysis (Table 2), the clinical variables associated with AKI were peak serum lactic acid level, cirrhosis of the liver, and higher cumulative number of organ failures (excluding AKI and including hepatic failure and hematological failure).
SEMI	NEG	PMC5319501.xml	S123	Discussion	NEG	Our results confirm previous findings.[15,20]
SEMI	NEG	PMC5319502.xml	S18		NEG	Most attention has been devoted to the risk of hematological malignancy in RA patients.[5,6]
SEMI	NEG	PMC5319502.xml	S20		NEG	The incidence of lung cancer[1–3] and cervical cancer[4] is higher in RA patients than in the general population, and the incidence of breast and colon cancers is lower.[2,3,6,7]
SEMI	NEG	PMC5319502.xml	S39		NEG	The ethical review board of the China Medical University in Taiwan approved this study (DMR101-IRB1-138).
SEMI	NEG	PMC5319502.xml	S43		NEG	The database of RA patients was compiled from the Registry of Catastrophic Illness Database, a subsection of the NHIRD.[1]
SEMI	NEG	PMC5319502.xml	S45		NEG	The Bureau of NHI requires each diagnosis of catastrophic illness to be confirmed by at least 2 specialists who carefully review original medical records, laboratory data, and imaging findings.
SEMI	NEG	PMC5319502.xml	S67		NEG	Solid cancers comprised all-cancers except hematologic malignancy (ICD-9-CM 200–208).
SEMI	NEG	PMC5319502.xml	S95		NEG	Preliminarily, we found the SIR of all-cancer relative to the general population was 0.80 (95% confidence interval [CI] 0.54–1.15) in RA patients treated with TNFi and 1.33 (95% CI 1.23–1.43) in patients who were naive to biologics (no tabulated data presented).
SEMI	NEG	PMC5319502.xml	S106		NEG	Other than peptic ulcer, the prevalence of comorbidities was not significantly different between the etanercept-treated and the matched biologic-naive cohorts.
SEMI	NEG	PMC5319502.xml	S107		NEG	The mean disease duration of RA before the index date for RA patients who received etanercept was 2.0 ± 1.5 years (Table 1), and the mean duration of etanercept use was 2.26 ± 1.31 years (Table 2).
SEMI	NEG	PMC5319502.xml	S117		NEG	For both male and female RA patients, those treated with etanercept had a significantly lower occurrence of solid cancer.
SEMI	NEG	PMC5319502.xml	S129		NEG	First, we used a 1-to-1 matching design and matched patients for MTX use in addition to the duration of RA history, index date of TNFi prescription, and traditional covariates of age and gender.
SEMI	NEG	PMC5319502.xml	S133		NEG	Including patients who switch between different biologics may introduce confounding by indication and may cause difficulties in identifying the true effects of TNFi.[34]
SEMI	NEG	PMC5319502.xml	S136		NEG	Our estimate of cancer risk reduction that is associated with etanercept is close to that reported in a British cohort,[32] but the beneficial effect on the risk of solid cancer demonstrated in our study is in contrast to the negative effect on the risk of lymphoproliferative malignancy in the British cohort.
SEMI	POS	PMC5319502.xml	S139		POS	This study has several limitations.
SEMI	POS	PMC5319502.xml	S140		POS	First, although a potential misclassification may have led to an underestimation of the association between TNFi and cancer, the RA patients enrolled in this study were from the Catastrophic Illness Database and met the criteria for RA and malignant diseases.
SEMI	POS	PMC5319502.xml	S141		POS	The potential coding error was therefore minimized.
SEMI	POS	PMC5319502.xml	S142		POS	Second, there may have been a surveillance bias in patients treated with TNFi, which may have contributed to an increased frequency of cancer in this cohort and thus underestimated the beneficial effect of TNFi on the risk of malignancy.
SEMI	POS	PMC5319502.xml	S143		POS	In contrast, a potential selection bias that results from strictly excluding patients who develop cancer in the first year of treatment may have occurred and could over-estimate the beneficial effect of TNFi on the risk of malignancy.
SEMI	POS	PMC5319502.xml	S144		POS	However, RA patients who develop cancer before the index date were all excluded, and those TNFi-treated patients who developed cancer during the 1st year of observation (n = 3) were also excluded, along with their matched counterparts, from the analysis.
SEMI	POS	PMC5319502.xml	S145		POS	This may preserve the comparability between the etanercept-treated patients and the matched biologic-naive references.
SEMI	POS	PMC5319502.xml	S146		POS	Third, as this was not a randomized clinical trial, we cannot attribute all the observed benefit of malignancy reduction to TNFi.
SEMI	POS	PMC5319502.xml	S147		POS	The NHIRD does not provide laboratory data or serologic information on inflammation, records of disease activity score, metabolic profiles, body mass index, family history of malignant diseases, or information on personal habits such as cigarette smoking and alcohol drinking, all of which may contribute to cancer risk.
SEMI	POS	PMC5319502.xml	S148		POS	In addition, a bias confounded by indication may account for differences in outcomes, that is, those patients who were considered to have a higher risk of cancer did not get treated with TNFi.
SEMI	POS	PMC5319502.xml	S149		POS	However, after matching the TNFi-treated and biologic-naive patients for age, gender, RA duration, and MTX use, the prevalence of comorbidities between these 2 groups was generally balanced except peptic ulcer.
SEMI	POS	PMC5319502.xml	S150		POS	Fourth, the patients who switched between different TNFi or switched to other biologics were excluded in the present study.
SEMI	POS	PMC5319502.xml	S151		POS	Although this method may avoid confounding by indication and help identify the true effect of etanercept, a potential threat to the generalizability of the results should be considered.
SEMI	POS	PMC5319502.xml	S152		POS	Fifth, although the TNFi-treated patients may have a more active inflammatory condition and may have a higher risk of developing malignancy than the biologic-naive patients, and although an immortal time bias may have occurred because of early death in patients treated with TNFi, the date of first use of TNFi in the TNFi-treated patients was randomly matched with the biologic-naive patients, and the covariates including comorbidities and concomitant medication were also adjusted in the Cox model.
SEMI	POS	PMC5319502.xml	S153		POS	This may allow us to infer causation between TNFi and the risk of cancer occurrence.
SEMI	NEG	PMC5319502.xml	S155		NEG	Early death that is due to comorbidity or infection in RA patients treated with TNFi may affect the development of malignancy.[16,35]
SEMI	NEG	PMC5319502.xml	S168		NEG	In an extension of previous findings that treatment with TNFi does not increase the risk of malignancy in RA patients,[5–7,21–23] the current study demonstrated a potential benefit of etanercept on all-cancer[31,32] and solid cancer.
SEMI	NEG	PMC5319503.xml	S5	Abstract	NEG	This study was designed to investigate whether arginine methylation dysfunction is associated with acute coronary syndrome risk in coronary artery disease population.
SEMI	NEG	PMC5319503.xml	S82	Results	NEG	AMI and hsCRP were identified as the independent protector or risk factor for ACS (OR = 0.975, 95% CI 0.956–0.993, P = 0.008; OR = 1.258, 95% CI 1.100–1.439, P = 0.001, respectively).
SEMI	NEG	PMC5319503.xml	S110	Discussion	NEG	In this study, we used AMI as an index for metabolism dysfunction and found it was also an independent predictor of acute coronary events in patients of CAD.
SEMI	NEG	PMC5319503.xml	S113	Discussion	NEG	In the future, arginine metabolic amino acids may become additional biochemical parameters for clinical routine to identify those patients at higher risk for future cardiovascular events.
SEMI	NEG	PMC5319504.xml	S20	Introduction	NEG	These nonmotor symptoms may include olfactory dysfunction, sleep disorder, constipation, depression, irritable bowel syndrome, hearing loss, cataract, and others.
SEMI	NEG	PMC5319504.xml	S59	Methods	NEG	Principal diagnosis and secondary diagnosis were applied equally.
SEMI	NEG	PMC5319504.xml	S101	Discussion	NEG	[18] To the best of our knowledge, this present study was the first cohort study using the population database to reveal such an association between herpes zoster and Parkinson's disease.
SEMI	NEG	PMC5319504.xml	S109	Discussion	NEG	Increasing evidence has indicated that neuroinflammation and immunological changes play the significant roles in contributing to neuron death in Parkinson's disease, in which microglia activation and other immune cells at sites of neuronal injury is detected.[15–17]
SEMI	NEG	PMC5319506.xml	S56	Discussion	NEG	Here, we report a case of SVPTC with brain, lung, and cervical lymph node metastases associated with a very low serum Tg level and a negative WBS.
SEMI	NEG	PMC5319506.xml	S66	Discussion	NEG	Alternatively, Tg might be cleared more rapidly from plasma.[19]
SEMI	NEG	PMC5319506.xml	S71	Discussion	NEG	To our patient, her tumor cells were positive for Tg on immunohistochemistry.
SEMI	NEG	PMC5319506.xml	S73	Discussion	NEG	The low Tg level may be explained by the reduced Tg release in marginally differentiated metastatic tumors and an altered Tg structure that cannot be detected by routine methods.
SEMI	NEG	PMC5319507.xml	S53	Results	NEG	Symptomatic supportive treatments were applied to all the patients, including close monitoring of vital signs, fluid status, nutritional status, electrolytes, and liver function.

SEMI	NEG	PMC5319516.xml	S96	Results	NEG	The decreases in TG levels were significant in the ZA10 and A40 groups at 4 and 8 weeks (P < 0.01), while the decrease in TG in the A20 group was only significant at 8 weeks (P < 0.01).
SEMI	NEG	PMC5319516.xml	S111	Discussion	NEG	However, most intensive lipid-lowering studies tried to achieve better clinical efficacy by increasing the doses of statins, which led to increased incidence of adverse effects.[19]

SEMI	NEG	PMC5319523.xml	S117	Results	NEG	Parameter estimation showed that the path coefficients had reached a significant level (P < 0.001), which indicated that the estimated parameters were in a reasonable range (as shown in Table 5).
SEMI	NEG	PMC5319523.xml	S123	Discussion	NEG	If there is a balance between the coagulation and anticoagulation systems and fibrinolysis and antifibrinolysis systems, it is possible to have a hypercoagulable state or a bleeding tendency.
SEMI	NEG	PMC5319523.xml	S153	Discussion	NEG	Our results also suggest that the anticoagulation and fibrinolysis status may reflect the staging of chronic schistosomiasis to a certain extent.
SEMI	NEG	PMC5319523.xml	S155	Discussion	NEG	Although the relationship of staging of chronic schistosomiasis and the anticoagulation and fibrinolysis status was recovered in this study, there was still some limitations, for example the lack of age-matched control, replication validation of the model, and the potential bias or imprecision of the study.
SEMI	NEG	PMC5319524.xml	S18		NEG	There has been a worldwide epidemic in obesity linking increased morbidity and mortality as one of the major public health problems across countries.

SEMI	NEG	PMC5319526.xml	S129	Discussion	NEG	Generally, the left transthoracic approach may be easy to perform and have fewer complications.
SEMI	NEG	PMC5319526.xml	S140	Discussion	NEG	Previous studies investigated the optimal extent of abdominal lymph node dissection in patients with Siewert type II AEG.[21,24–25]
SEMI	NEG	PMC5319526.xml	S144	Discussion	NEG	Chen et al[18] believe that dissection of the lymph nodes at the cardia, lesser curvature of the stomach, and the left gastric artery has high therapeutic value, and that dissection of the lymph nodes at the greater curvature of the stomach, hepatic artery, splenic artery, and celiac trunk has some therapeutic value.
SEMI	NEG	PMC5319526.xml	S162	Conclusion	NEG	Right transthoracic Ivor–Lewis esophagogastrectomy does not increase perioperative mortality and the incidence of complications in Siewert type II AEG compared with the traditional left transthoracic approach.
SEMI	NEG	PMC5319527.xml	S27		NEG	Therefore, using JDDM data we sought to determine the factors that influence the choice of each of 3 hypoglycemic agents prescribed as initial monotherapy by specialists as well as the patients’ factors that influenced the continuation or discontinuation of the drug or the addition of another drug over a 1-year period.
SEMI	NEG	PMC5319527.xml	S48		NEG	All statistical analyses were performed by SPSS (version 19.0, Chicago, IL), and statistical significance was considered for P < 0.05.
SEMI	NEG	PMC5319527.xml	S79		NEG	Moreover, the choice of biguanides differs greatly from the choice of a sulfonylurea or DPP-4I with regard to age and obesity, which might reflect specialists’ consideration of insulin resistance, insulin secretion, or side effects.
SEMI	NEG	PMC5319527.xml	S120		NEG	Moreover, we could not separately analyze random glucose and postprandial glucose.
SEMI	NEG	PMC5319528.xml	S22	Introduction	NEG	Therefore, coronary angiography (CAG) and percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI) are important procedures for improving survival in patients with OHCA after ROSC.
SEMI	NEG	PMC5319528.xml	S41	Methods	NEG	If there was no definitive coronary artery lesion in emergent CAG, secondary CAG with a spasm test was performed to identify coronary spasm.
SEMI	NEG	PMC5319528.xml	S79	Results	NEG	Among these patients who admitted, 44 were classified into the STsE or LBBB group and all of them had emergent CAG performed.

SEMI	NEG	PMC5319528.xml	S96	Discussion	NEG	Acute coronary syndrome is the most common cause of OHCA.[6,22]
SEMI	NEG	PMC5319528.xml	S99	Discussion	NEG	In contrast, Warnes and Roberts[24] reported that there were only 13 cases of coronary thrombi in 70 sudden coronary death victims.
SEMI	NEG	PMC5319528.xml	S102	Discussion	NEG	Emergent CAG for OHCA with STsE or new LBBB is currently strongly recommended.[19,27]
SEMI	NEG	PMC5319528.xml	S104	Discussion	NEG	A recent large, retrospective study in the US reported an increasing proportion of performing CAG in OHCA survivors with ventricular tachycardia (VT)/ventricular fibrillation(VF), even without STsE in ECG, and also showed improving survival to discharge.[17]
SEMI	NEG	PMC5319528.xml	S130	Discussion	NEG	Post-ROSC ECG alone should not be considered as a strict selection criterion for performing emergent CAG in OHCA victims without obvious arrest cause other than cardiac causes.[31]
SEMI	NEG	PMC5319528.xml	S131	Discussion	NEG	Therefore, acute coronary problems are difficult to predict in OHCA survivors based on clinical and electrocardiographic data alone.
SEMI	POS	PMC5319528.xml	S135	Limitations	POS	This study was designed as a nonrandomized, observational, retrospective study based on prospectively collected data in a registry.
SEMI	POS	PMC5319528.xml	S136	Limitations	POS	All of the OHCA survivors who showed STsE or new-onset LBBB in post-ROSC ECG underwent emergent CAG.
SEMI	POS	PMC5319528.xml	S137	Limitations	POS	For other patients whose post-ECG did not show STsE or new-onset LBBB, the decision for performing CAG was made by specialists from emergency medicine or cardiology faculties.
SEMI	POS	PMC5319528.xml	S138	Limitations	POS	This might have caused selection bias.
SEMI	POS	PMC5319528.xml	S139	Limitations	POS	However, to reduce such bias, we classified our patients into 2 groups according to post-ROSC ECG by 1 emergency physician who was blinded to the patients’ CAG results, treatment course, and prognosis.
SEMI	POS	PMC5319528.xml	S140	Limitations	POS	Except for 1 patient whose next of kin refused to perform PCI, other excluded patients appeared to have an obvious noncardiac cause.
SEMI	POS	PMC5319528.xml	S141	Limitations	POS	The effect of selection bias might not be significant.
SEMI	POS	PMC5319528.xml	S142	Limitations	POS	This study was conducted in single center and the number of OHCA survivors who underwent PCI was relatively small.
SEMI	POS	PMC5319528.xml	S143	Limitations	POS	Even though a small number of patients were analyzed, we found 7 patients with coronary spasm in the nonspecific EGC group.
SEMI	POS	PMC5319528.xml	S144	Limitations	POS	This might be the reason why we need to perform CAG in OHCA victims without STsE or new-onset LBBB.
SEMI	POS	PMC5319528.xml	S145	Limitations	POS	Further investigation might be required to determine the appropriate timing for when to perform PCI for OHCA survivors who do not show STsE or new-onset LBBB.

SEMI	NEG	PMC5319529.xml	S143	Conclusion	NEG	Leiomyoma-related symptoms improved comparably as well; these symptoms included menstrual blood loss, hemoglobin levels, dysmenorrhea, and non-menstrual abdominal pain.
SEMI	NEG	PMC5319530.xml	S48	Patients and methods	NEG	This study was approved as part of surgical audit by the West of Scotland Research Ethics Committee.

SEMI	NEG	PMC5319530.xml	S71	Patients and methods	NEG	Missing data were excluded from analysis.
SEMI	NEG	PMC5319530.xml	S92	Results	NEG	There was a trend toward greater need for postoperative intervention (7% vs 3%, P = 0.089).
SEMI	NEG	PMC5319530.xml	S121	Discussion	NEG	However, further work is required to confirm this observation.
SEMI	POS	PMC5319530.xml	S122	Discussion	POS	The present study has several limitations.
SEMI	POS	PMC5319530.xml	S123	Discussion	POS	Due to the observational nature of the study only a small number of patients received rectal contrast, and a small number received no contrast via any route due to renal failure, which may have reduced the diagnostic accuracy of CT.
SEMI	POS	PMC5319530.xml	S124	Discussion	POS	In many cases in which patients did not go on to reoperation the diagnosis of any complication relied directly on the CT scan report, although the use of Clavien Dindo grading has hopefully increased the objectivity of complication recording.
SEMI	POS	PMC5319530.xml	S125	Discussion	POS	Furthermore, although the present study investigated CRP thresholds on day 4, the median time to CT imaging was 7 days.
SEMI	POS	PMC5319530.xml	S126	Discussion	POS	Therefore the results may not reflect the accuracy of CT performed earlier in the postoperative course.

SEMI	NEG	PMC5319532.xml	S121	Discussion	NEG	The sample size needs to be increased and multicentered research needs to be done as well.
SEMI	NEG	PMC5319534.xml	S14	Abstract	NEG	Patients who were younger, from lower socioeconomic strata, and higher BMI were more likely to be over or under-replaced.
SEMI	NEG	PMC5319534.xml	S25	Introduction	NEG	Cost of treatment is another potential deterrent to medication adherence.

SEMI	NEG	PMC5319534.xml	S58	Methods	NEG	In the absence of local data, the study by Okosieme et al[2] was selected to compute the sample size.
SEMI	NEG	PMC5319534.xml	S66	Methods	NEG	Similarly, those with overt hypothyroid status may be of clinical concern even if TSH is below 10 mU/L.

SEMI	POS	PMC5319534.xml	S151	Discussion	POS	However, 46 subjects did not fit into the categories but probable reasons for patients in these gray areas were provided.
SEMI	POS	PMC5319534.xml	S152	Discussion	POS	The cross-sectional nature of the data provides a snapshot of the state of the management of primary hypothyroidism in primary care.
SEMI	POS	PMC5319534.xml	S153	Discussion	POS	It did not reflect the dynamic nature of the clinical practices amongst the primary care physicians who were adjusting their patients’ L-T4 doses to attain a state of euthyroidism.
SEMI	POS	PMC5319534.xml	S154	Discussion	POS	Finally, the data from the MARS-5 instrument relied on self-reporting by patients, which the investigators were not able to verify in this study.
SEMI	POS	PMC5319534.xml	S155	Discussion	POS	However, the questions are easily understood and paralleled the pragmatic approach used by physicians to assess medication adherence in clinical practice.

SEMI	NEG	PMC5319535.xml	S82	Methods	NEG	The SOT is a valid[21,22] and reliable test[23,24] for measuring balance performance in younger individuals.
SEMI	NEG	PMC5319535.xml	S84	Methods	NEG	In addition, our previous study showed that the intraclass correlation coefficient (ICC) values for the SOT condition-specific equilibrium score (ES) ranged from 0.50 to 0.77 in healthy young persons, indicating moderate to good reliability.[23]
SEMI	NEG	PMC5319535.xml	S158	Results	NEG	There was a significant group-by-time interaction effect on knee joint proprioception (F (2, 50) = 4.757, P = 0.013, ηp2 = 0.160).
SEMI	NEG	PMC5319535.xml	S196	Discussion	NEG	The study showed that immersion in both very cold and room-temperature water does not alter athletes’ bipedal standing balance performance after exhaustive exercise.
SEMI	POS	PMC5319535.xml	S199	Discussion	POS	This study has some limitations.
SEMI	POS	PMC5319535.xml	S200	Discussion	POS	First, due to the nature of the interventions, the participants were not blinded to the treatment allocation.
SEMI	POS	PMC5319535.xml	S201	Discussion	POS	Therefore, the placebo effect may have introduced bias in the results.
SEMI	POS	PMC5319535.xml	S202	Discussion	POS	Second, we only measured the sensory aspect of postural control using a computerized dynamic posturography machine but postural control is a complex process invloving multisystems.
SEMI	POS	PMC5319535.xml	S203	Discussion	POS	Further studies may explore the effects of water immersion on the motor aspect of postural control and the functional or sports performance of amateur rugby players.
SEMI	POS	PMC5319535.xml	S204	Discussion	POS	Finally, our results can only be generalized to specifically rugby players, but not other types of high-performance athletes.
SEMI	NEG	PMC5319536.xml	S29	Methods	NEG	IRB allows waiving the requirement for obtaining informed consent, and patient records were anonymized and deidentified prior to analysis.
SEMI	NEG	PMC5319536.xml	S30	Methods	NEG	The information was retrieved from the medical records and the electronic database of Tri-Service General Hospital (TSGH; Taipei, Taiwan, Republic of China).
SEMI	NEG	PMC5319536.xml	S82	Discussion	NEG	The 1st finding was consistent with several previous studies showing that GA using TCI system with propofol could achieve faster extubation than using DES in different surgeries.[9–12,18]
SEMI	NEG	PMC5319536.xml	S103	Discussion	NEG	Therefore, the effect of accumulation and redistribution of propofol on extubation should be less than syringe pump with continuous infusion of propofol.
SEMI	NEG	PMC5319538.xml	S55	Results	NEG	A total of 140 patients completed this study (Fig. 2), and the baseline clinical characteristics and airway assessment findings were similar between the 2 groups (Table 1).
SEMI	NEG	PMC5319538.xml	S62	Discussion	NEG	To our knowledge, this is the first randomized controlled clinical trial to compare the efficacy of 60° vs 90° angled malleable stylets with standard ETT loading using a McGrath VL.
SEMI	NEG	PMC5319538.xml	S66	Discussion	NEG	Additionally, the distal tip of the 90° styletted tube had a tendency to veer toward the anterior commissure, and it was difficult to advance the tube into the trachea at the vocal cord.
SEMI	NEG	PMC5319538.xml	S76	Discussion	NEG	McElwain et al[21] found that there was no advantage in the easy laryngoscopy scenario and that the hockey stick configuration performed best in the difficult scenario.
SEMI	NEG	PMC5319539.xml	S7	Abstract	NEG	Patient height, weight, sex, and age were also recorded.
SEMI	NEG	PMC5319539.xml	S30	Methods	NEG	Patients who had ambiguous anatomical outlines due to poor-quality CT images were also excluded.
SEMI	NEG	PMC5319539.xml	S49	Results	NEG	In total, 778 patients underwent neck CTs from January 2010 to December 2012.
SEMI	NEG	PMC5319539.xml	S67	Discussion	NEG	According to a previous study, the cuff ballottement test is a reliable method that predicts when the tip of the ETT lies in the desired position, 3 to 7 cm from the carina, at the level of T3–4.[4]
SEMI	POS	PMC5319539.xml	S92	Discussion	POS	Our study has several limitations.
SEMI	POS	PMC5319539.xml	S93	Discussion	POS	First, we did not assess the relationship between VSD-15 and the incidence of postoperative sore throat, hoarseness, or vocal cord paralysis.
SEMI	POS	PMC5319539.xml	S94	Discussion	POS	Further studies are needed to evaluate the correlation between the vocal cord-to-suprasternal notch distance and postoperative laryngeal complications.
SEMI	POS	PMC5319539.xml	S95	Discussion	POS	Second, our findings are restricted to Asians, although airway length does not differ between Western and Oriental individuals according to previous studies.[17,19]

SEMI	NEG	PMC5319540.xml	S36		NEG	Health promotion works through concrete and effective actions made in setting priorities.[13]
SEMI	NEG	PMC5319540.xml	S64		NEG	The detailed findings have been described elsewhere.[24,25]
SEMI	NEG	PMC5319540.xml	S68		NEG	Of the 5241 students enrolled in the survey and health check-up in 2013, 40.4% were lack in physical activity, 44.8% skipped breakfast, 77.6% had insufficient fruit intake, 26.4% were either overweight or obese, 12.3% reported heavy drinking, 5.5% were currently smoking, and 29% reported mental health issues.[25]
SEMI	NEG	PMC5319540.xml	S92		NEG	Because activity-oriented health programs are known to inspire more learning and be more effective in changing behaviors than a passive look-and-see approach,[23,27] many health booths provided interactive hands-on learning activities and emphasized skill-building perspectives.
SEMI	NEG	PMC5319540.xml	S104		NEG	To increase interest in the evaluation survey and avoid overlapping populations, we provided survey participants with a stamp on their health passports and did not enroll those who already had a survey stamp on their passports.
SEMI	NEG	PMC5319540.xml	S106		NEG	This study was approved by the SNU Research Ethics Committee in 2013 (SNUIRB 1301/001-007).
SEMI	NEG	PMC5319540.xml	S111		NEG	The main questions were related to 2 issues: whether the program was successful in achieving its plan of action especially during the implementation phase (program delivery and process evaluation); and what were the effects of the program's activities and services on participants’ awareness of health promotion (program results evaluation)?
SEMI	NEG	PMC5319540.xml	S122		NEG	We compared participants’ evaluations of health lectures and booths/events using a general linear model with adjustments for age, sex, position, and academic status.
SEMI	NEG	PMC5319540.xml	S147		NEG	The participants’ overall program evaluation scores were high.
SEMI	POS	PMC5319540.xml	S229		POS	This study has the following limitations.
SEMI	POS	PMC5319540.xml	S230		POS	First, its cross-sectional nature limits causal and temporal inferences.
SEMI	POS	PMC5319540.xml	S231		POS	Because program participants might have higher awareness of health than those who did not attend, it could have affected our results.
SEMI	POS	PMC5319540.xml	S232		POS	Second, we did not measure changes in health awareness.
SEMI	POS	PMC5319540.xml	S233		POS	Participants were asked about their past and current awareness simultaneously; thus, their current perceptions or inaccurate recall might have biased their responses.
SEMI	POS	PMC5319540.xml	S234		POS	This makes it difficult to believe the t test result was adequately convincing.
SEMI	POS	PMC5319540.xml	S235		POS	Third, we used convenience sampling, and not a representative sample of all the participants.
SEMI	POS	PMC5319540.xml	S236		POS	In reality, obtaining a representative sample at a public health program is a major challenge because those programs are usually held as open-ended and unstructured events in a public space with many people coming and going.[23,44]
SEMI	POS	PMC5319540.xml	S237		POS	Fourth, as the survey was conducted during the program, we cannot be sure the participants’ reported perceptions will be sustained in the long-term.
SEMI	POS	PMC5319540.xml	S238		POS	Last, we did not evaluate health outcomes.
SEMI	POS	PMC5319540.xml	S239		POS	In practice, however, no single evaluation is likely to address all dimensions of health promotion programs.[14]
SEMI	NEG	PMC5319541.xml	S60	Patients and methods	NEG	The categorical variables were analyzed by R × C chi-squared test or Kruskal–Wallis H test.

SEMI	NEG	PMC5319541.xml	S137	Discussion	NEG	In western country, the prevalence of ALD is usually the highest among people ages 18 to 34 years old.
SEMI	NEG	PMC5319541.xml	S143	Discussion	NEG	There are some limitations that deserve further discussion.
SEMI	NEG	PMC5319542.xml	S49	Case presentation	NEG	Bulldog was used to clamp the right portal vein transiently for ischemic line, and the transection line was marked by electric cautery along the ischemic line.
SEMI	NEG	PMC5319542.xml	S53	Case presentation	NEG	The right liver graft was placed in a retrieval bag and took out from suprapubic incision.
SEMI	NEG	PMC5319542.xml	S56	Case presentation	NEG	Two large short hepatic veins with 0.5 cm and 0.6 cm in diameter, respectively, drained to inferior vena cava; therefore, we planned to reconstruct the outflow of short hepatic vein.
SEMI	NEG	PMC5319542.xml	S100	Conclusions	NEG	.Intraoperative cholangiography is not a necessary step in some conditions including no variation in preoperative evaluation of the biliary tract, intraoperative meticulous dissection with clear anatomical relationship of common hepatic duct, right and left hepatic duct, right hepatic duct length greater than 1 cm; if the above conditions can’t be met, cholangiography is a required procedure.3
SEMI	NEG	PMC5319543.xml	S13	Abstract	NEG	28%, P = 0.02, 95% CI of the difference 2%–32%).
SEMI	NEG	PMC5319543.xml	S18	Introduction	NEG	Perioperative myocardial infarction remains a frequent and life-threatening complication in noncardiac surgery.[1–3]
SEMI	NEG	PMC5319543.xml	S52	Material and methods	NEG	Prospectively collected data included age, sex, living conditions, walking ability, functional autonomy, medical history, medications, type of fracture and surgical treatment, type of anesthesia (general vs locoregional), and any nerve block provided for analgesia.
SEMI	NEG	PMC5319543.xml	S78	Material and methods	NEG	Secondary end points included acute care and/or rehabilitation mortality, 30-day mortality, 6-month mortality, 6-month functional outcome (ability to walk, ADL, and IADL), and new institutionalization.
SEMI	NEG	PMC5319543.xml	S82	Material and methods	NEG	Data are expressed as mean ± SD or median (25th–75th interquartile) for non-Gaussian variables, and number (percentages).
SEMI	NEG	PMC5319543.xml	S116	Results	NEG	Ejection fraction was 54% ± 21% (n = 48), 53% ± 20% (n = 17), and 43% ± 25% (n = 16), in control, ITR, and ACS groups, respectively, without significant difference between groups (P = 0.24).
SEMI	NEG	PMC5319543.xml	S124	Results	NEG	Among the 310 patients with complete follow-up, death occurred in 53 (17%) patients and rehospitalization occurred in 45 (15%) patients, and 93 (30%) patients fulfilled the primary endpoint (death and/or rehospitalization).
SEMI	NEG	PMC5319543.xml	S131	Results	NEG	In contrast, the risk of new institutionalization was significantly increased in the ACS group compared with the Control group (Fig. 2).
SEMI	NEG	PMC5319543.xml	S135	Results	NEG	Within this matched population, the odds ratio associated with postoperative ITR to predict 6-month mortality and/or rehospitalization was 1.04 (95% CI 0.50–2.13; P = 0.92).
SEMI	NEG	PMC5319543.xml	S141	Discussion	NEG	In this study, we found that ITR was not predictive of death and/or rehospitalization during the 6-month period following hip fracture in elderly patients.
SEMI	NEG	PMC5319543.xml	S164	Discussion	NEG	Subsequently, the mortality risk returns to that of an equivalent elderly population without hip fracture.[24]
SEMI	NEG	PMC5319543.xml	S177	Discussion	NEG	Our study has several strengths.
SEMI	POS	PMC5319543.xml	S181	Discussion	POS	Our study has several limitations.
SEMI	POS	PMC5319543.xml	S182	Discussion	POS	First, this study must be considered as essentially retrospective.
SEMI	POS	PMC5319543.xml	S183	Discussion	POS	Nevertheless, data were collected prospectively and the statistical plan was determined before the analysis.
SEMI	POS	PMC5319543.xml	S184	Discussion	POS	Second, the sample size in the ITR group was relatively low (n = 50) and thus the power of our study may have been insufficient to show a significant difference.
SEMI	POS	PMC5319543.xml	S185	Discussion	POS	Nevertheless, it should be pointed that the difference observed between the ITR and Control groups was very low (Fig. 2), suggesting that, even if it exists, this difference is probably not clinically significant.
SEMI	POS	PMC5319543.xml	S186	Discussion	POS	Moreover, looking at many other outcome variables, we failed to identify any poor prognosis signal in the ITR group.
SEMI	POS	PMC5319543.xml	S187	Discussion	POS	Third, we did not use the ultrasensitive method of analysis of troponin.
SEMI	POS	PMC5319543.xml	S188	Discussion	POS	However, we do not think that this point may have interfered with our results as ultrasensitive method may have only detected even more subtle increase in troponin without clinical significance.
SEMI	POS	PMC5319543.xml	S189	Discussion	POS	Fourth, we did not systematically measure preoperative cTnI and we cannot rule out the possibility that some patients had chronically elevated cTnI concentrations that were unchanged postoperatively, particularly those with chronic renal failure.
SEMI	POS	PMC5319543.xml	S190	Discussion	POS	Fifth, we did not measure preoperative cTnI in all patients but, in previous studies, preoperative troponin measurements before elective surgery was not significantly associated with poor outcome.[39]
SEMI	POS	PMC5319543.xml	S191	Discussion	POS	Lastly, our results may not apply to other orthogeriatric models reported in the literature.[16–21]
SEMI	POS	PMC5319543.xml	S192	Discussion	POS	Our model is essentially characterized by an early admission to a dedicated geriatric unit, a high rate of early surgery (i.e., <24 hours after admission),[22] and this model has been shown to markedly decrease mortality and improve autonomy, walking ability, and functional status.[24]

SEMI	NEG	PMC5319544.xml	S75	Introduction	NEG	The proliferation index, as indicated by Ki-67 labeling, was over 90%.
SEMI	NEG	PMC5319544.xml	S84	Discussion	NEG	Only cases with a definitive pathologic diagnosis of PBL and description of no HIV infection were selected.
SEMI	NEG	PMC5319544.xml	S110	Discussion	NEG	Additionally, the proteasome inhibitor Bortezomib may become a new therapeutic option for PBL given the dramatic responses from previous results.
SEMI	NEG	PMC5319545.xml	S3	Abstract	NEG	To evaluate the clinicopathological characteristics and factors that lead to residual tumors in patients who underwent additional gastrectomy for incomplete endoscopic resection (ER) for early gastric cancer (EGC).

SEMI	NEG	PMC5319545.xml	S119	Discussion	NEG	An ESD method that involves direct exfoliation of the submucosal areas with a knife was introduced to allow for en bloc resection of larger lesions.[8,16]
SEMI	NEG	PMC5319545.xml	S162	Discussion	NEG	Based on these findings, the appropriate treatment should be chosen.
SEMI	NEG	PMC5319546.xml	S28	Patients and methods	NEG	We divided these stage IV cancer patients into 2 groups—a primary resection and a preoperative chemotherapy group.
SEMI	NEG	PMC5319546.xml	S33	Patients and methods	NEG	To adjust the severity of metastasis to preoperative chemotherapy group, we enrolled the patients who had ≥3 hepatic metastases in both groups.
SEMI	NEG	PMC5319546.xml	S48	Patients and methods	NEG	For patients in the preoperative chemotherapy group who received first-line chemotherapy, tumor responses were assessed every 3 to 4 cycles using the Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumors (RECIST).[11,12]
SEMI	NEG	PMC5319546.xml	S148	Discussion	NEG	However, these methods can minimize selection bias.
SEMI	NEG	PMC5319547.xml	S7	Abstract	NEG	Adjusted odds ratios and their 95% confidence intervals of periodontitis for the floss group and the powered toothbrush group after adjustment were 0.678 (0.588, 0.781) and 0.771 (0.610, 0.974), respectively.
SEMI	NEG	PMC5319547.xml	S68	Methods	NEG	Presence of tooth pain, experience of orthodontic treatment, and dental checkup within a year were also evaluated.
SEMI	NEG	PMC5319547.xml	S71	Methods	NEG	The mouth was divided into sextants and each sextant was examined only if 2 or more teeth were present, which were not scheduled for extraction.
SEMI	NEG	PMC5319547.xml	S139	Discussion	NEG	This study clearly showed that a lower prevalence of periodontal disease was associated with toothbrushing after lunch and before bedtime, and toothbrushing after dinner was associated with a lower prevalence of severe periodontitis.
SEMI	NEG	PMC5320641.xml	S9	Background	NEG	Hematoxylin-eosin (HE), Van Gieson staining and immunohistochemistry (IHC) were performed to observe the histomorphology of lung tissue.
SEMI	NEG	PMC5320641.xml	S22	Background	NEG	The online version of this article (doi:10.1186/s12931-017-0523-z) contains supplementary material, which is available to authorized users.
SEMI	NEG	PMC5320641.xml	S26	Background	NEG	Ang II, a major renin-angiotensin peptide can increase expression of transforming growth factor-β (TGF-β) and promote an Ang II/TGF-β1 “autocrine loop,” which initiates a fibrogenic signaling pathway [5].
SEMI	NEG	PMC5320641.xml	S82	Methods	NEG	Samples were incubated in 10% donkey serum (92590, Temecula, CA) for 30 min at 37 °C.
SEMI	NEG	PMC5323480.xml	S3	Background	NEG	Non-alcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD) is frequently accompanied by iron overload.
SEMI	NEG	PMC5323480.xml	S25	Introduction	NEG	Non-alcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD) is associated with liver steatosis caused by metabolic disorders without previous excessive alcohol intake.
SEMI	NEG	PMC5323480.xml	S142	Results	NEG	Because we identified several inflammatory signal pathways that activate SMADs and signal transducers and activators of transcription (STAT)-3, which both trigger hepcidin expression and further cause iron-deficiency in liver tissue, we speculated that most of the inflammatory pathways detected in our analysis affected SMAD and STAT3 transcriptional activity in fatty livers.
SEMI	NEG	PMC5323480.xml	S177	Discussion	NEG	Hereditary hemochromatosis develops when hepcidin expression is reduced due to a mutated hepcidin regulatory signal [20–22].
SEMI	NEG	PMC5324270.xml	S89	Results	NEG	Active smoking was recorded in 25 asthmatics (12%).
SEMI	NEG	PMC5324270.xml	S133	Results	NEG	Among them, six clusters (according to CCC, pseudo F and t2 statistics; Additional file 1: Figure E1B) could be identified: cluster I (similar profile to cluster 1) “IL-5-, IL-25-, IL-17A-, IL-17 F- and IL-10-high” (n = 2), cluster II (similar to cluster 2) “IL-5- and/or IL-10-high” but “IL-17 F-low” (n = 2), cluster III “IL-4-high” (n = 5), cluster IV “IL-4- and IL-13-high” (n = 9), cluster V (similar profile to cluster 4) “IL-22-high” (n = 3) and cluster VI (similar profile to cluster 5) normal cytokine levels or “IL-1β- or TNF-low” (n = 20).
SEMI	NEG	PMC5324270.xml	S173	Discussion	NEG	Those patients had rather high sputum neutrophils and normal sputum eosinophil counts.
SEMI	NEG	PMC5324270.xml	S178	Discussion	NEG	However, in this cluster, this occurs without elevation of any other T helper or pro-inflammatory cytokines, which discriminates them from the other clusters.
SEMI	NEG	PMC5324331.xml	S3	Background	NEG	It is known that tissue macrophages derive not only from blood monocytes but also from yolk sac or fetal liver, and the tissue of residence guides their function.
SEMI	NEG	PMC5324331.xml	S31	Background	NEG	We thought that lung response to cigarette smoke exposure and the consequent development of COPD, a chronic and progressive inflammatory disease, could be a model that fulfills these characteristics.
SEMI	NEG	PMC5324331.xml	S45	Methods	NEG	Positive alveolar macrophages, defined as mononuclear cells with a well-represented cytoplasm, present in the alveolar spaces, were quantified in at least 20 non-consecutive high-power fields inside the alveolar spaces in each subject.
SEMI	NEG	PMC5324331.xml	S75	Results	NEG	However, when analysed separately in the different subject groups, this difference remained statistically significant only in moderate COPD (p < 0.05) and in smokers without COPD (p < 0.01), but not in severe COPD, where the disease is fully established.
SEMI	NEG	PMC5326695.xml	S3	Objective	NEG	Inadequate right ventricular (RV) and pulmonary arterial (PA) functional responses to exercise are important yet poorly understood features of pulmonary arterial hypertension (PAH).
SEMI	NEG	PMC5330150.xml	S5		NEG	Three ATP-binding cassette (ABC) transporters are found in the mammalian lung – ABCA1, ABCG1 and ABCA3 – that are involved in movement of cholesterol and phospholipids from lung cells.
SEMI	NEG	PMC5330150.xml	S48		NEG	The critical role of ABCA1 in lung inflammation is evident from murine knockout models.
SEMI	NEG	PMC5330150.xml	S78		NEG	Furthermore, treatment of house dust mite-challenged mice with intranasal apoA-I was able to minimise eosinophilia, neutrophilia, interleukin (IL)-17E, IL-33 and airway hyperresponsiveness [40].
SEMI	NEG	PMC5330150.xml	S131		NEG	ABCG1 deficiency has been identified in patients with pulmonary alveolar proteinosis (PAP), a condition characterised by pulmonary surfactant accumulation [18].

SEMI	NEG	PMC5330195.xml	S130		NEG	Changing the culture of resuscitation decision making will not be easy, but newer approaches may offer a step towards achieving this.
SEMI	NEG	PMC5331711.xml	S9	Background	NEG	Among 694 participants with COPD (47% women, mean age 63.6 years) mean GDF-15 was 1,304 pg/mL, and mean CAC score was 198.
SEMI	NEG	PMC5331711.xml	S56	Methods	NEG	Co-morbidities and risk factors were ascertained by combining responses to questions on physician-based diagnosis and review of current medications.
SEMI	NEG	PMC5331711.xml	S58	Methods	NEG	Physical activity was considered limited based on affirming “Was your walk limited?” during a 6-min walk test.
SEMI	NEG	PMC5331711.xml	S78	Results	NEG	Almost half were considered at low cardiovascular risk (10 year CHD risk <10%) by HEART score.
SEMI	NEG	PMC5331711.xml	S104	Discussion	NEG	This analysis of 694 ever-smokers without clinical CVD at enrollment to the COPDGene cohort demonstrates that GDF-15 independently contributes to subclinical atherosclerosis in COPD.
SEMI	POS	PMC5331711.xml	S126	Discussion	POS	As a biomarker, GDF-15 has both strengths and limitations.
SEMI	POS	PMC5331711.xml	S127	Discussion	POS	Although GDF-15 appears to reflect an integrated stress response [15, 37], understanding the significance of an elevated concentration is complicated by its production by multiple cell-types and in response to disparate stimuli [43].
SEMI	POS	PMC5331711.xml	S128	Discussion	POS	Elevated GDF-15 may reflect endothelial cell dysfunction, common in advanced COPD and proposed as a shared pathway in CVD development [44].
SEMI	POS	PMC5331711.xml	S129	Discussion	POS	However, endothelial dysfunction in COPD appears to relate in part to intrathoracic mechanics rather than inflammation [45], and may associate with specific COPD phenotypes [46].
SEMI	POS	PMC5331711.xml	S130	Discussion	POS	Hence, GDF-15 might be elevated in individual COPD patients for diverse reasons.
SEMI	POS	PMC5331711.xml	S131	Discussion	POS	Thus, like TGF-β itself, GDF-15 may not be simply good or bad, but either, depending on context, underlining the need for greater understanding of its signal transduction in specific cell-types and clinical settings.
SEMI	NEG	PMC5331711.xml	S140	Conclusions	NEG	We demonstrate that in COPD subjects free of clinical CVD, subclinical atherosclerosis (measured as CAC on ungated HRCT) is frequent; and that GDF-15 contributes, independently of common cardiovascular risk factors and measures of COPD severity or phenotype, to its presence and severity.
SEMI	NEG	PMC5332591.xml	S58	Methods	NEG	We examined associations of CVD with neutrophil counts initially as a categorical variable.
SEMI	NEG	PMC5332591.xml	S70	Results	NEG	We included 621,052 patients with neutrophil counts while clinically stable and 154,179 patients with neutrophil counts performed during acute illness or treatment (Online Figure 1, Online Table 2).
SEMI	NEG	PMC5332591.xml	S71	Results	NEG	We observed 55,004 initial presentations of CVD over a median follow-up of 3.8 years (interquartile range [IQR]: 1.7 to 6.0 years).
SEMI	NEG	PMC5332591.xml	S77	Results	NEG	The risk difference appeared to be greatest for the first few months (Online Table 4).
SEMI	NEG	PMC5332591.xml	S85	Results	NEG	There was also an association of higher neutrophil count with the composite of CVD (Online Figure 3) and all-cause mortality (Online Figure 4).
SEMI	NEG	PMC5332591.xml	S87	Results	NEG	Because the associations between neutrophil counts and cardiovascular presentations were monotonic and linear, we treated neutrophil count as a linear variable in subsequent modeling.
SEMI	NEG	PMC5332591.xml	S121	Discussion	NEG	Mendelian randomization studies using single nucleotide polymorphisms for genes associated with neutrophil count, such as those identified in the 17q21 region (22), might also help to evaluate causal relevance.
SEMI	NEG	PMC5332591.xml	S126	Discussion	NEG	We adjusted for smoking in the main analysis, but if an increased neutrophil count (or the underlying chronic inflammation it represents) is on a causal pathway linking smoking to CVD, we might be overadjusting for smoking, thereby underestimating the component of cardiovascular risk conveyed by inflammation or neutrophils.
SEMI	NEG	PMC5332591.xml	S127	Discussion	NEG	Other modifiable factors that can increase the level of chronic low-grade inflammation include air pollution (27), obesity (28), lack of exercise (29), and periodontal disease (30).
SEMI	POS	PMC5332591.xml	S129	Discussion	POS	Although our study had strengths—its large size, population base, and extensive adjustment for potential confounders—it also had important limitations.
SEMI	POS	PMC5332591.xml	S130	Discussion	POS	Our distinction between acute and stable patients was crude, but the similarity of findings in both groups was reassuring.
SEMI	POS	PMC5332591.xml	S131	Discussion	POS	As with any observational study, the results cannot be taken to imply causation due to the possibility of residual confounding.
SEMI	POS	PMC5332591.xml	S132	Discussion	POS	The measurement of neutrophil counts was undertaken in usual clinical care, and by different laboratories without study-wide protocols.
SEMI	POS	PMC5332591.xml	S133	Discussion	POS	Heterogeneity of measurement methods and heterogeneity among the study population itself may have led to biased estimates of association, but these would tend to be underestimates.
SEMI	POS	PMC5332591.xml	S134	Discussion	POS	The ascertainment of endpoints was in coded clinical data without manual endpoint adjudication.
SEMI	POS	PMC5332591.xml	S135	Discussion	POS	All the data sources used in this study missed some events (15); however, any errors in endpoint recording were likely to be nondifferential in relation to the neutrophil count.
SEMI	POS	PMC5332591.xml	S136	Discussion	POS	Because our study was based on electronic health records, some values of baseline variables were missing for some patients.
SEMI	POS	PMC5332591.xml	S137	Discussion	POS	However, we obtained similar results by imputing missing data using 2 different methods of multiple imputation.
SEMI	NEG	PMC5333694.xml	S6	Objective	NEG	Breast reconstruction is an important treatment option for patients undergoing mastectomy.
SEMI	NEG	PMC5333694.xml	S9	Objective	NEG	We conducted a prospective cross-sectional study of patients planning mastectomy at a single site, over 20 months.
SEMI	NEG	PMC5335791.xml	S40	Methods	NEG	Consecutive patients undergoing surgical resection of SFTP between 1992 and 2013 at two tertiary care teaching hospitals and with a follow up of at least one month were eligible for the study.
SEMI	NEG	PMC5335791.xml	S69	Methods	NEG	Sequences of primers used in this study for reverse transcription and amplification of miRNAs are shown in Table 2.
SEMI	NEG	PMC5335791.xml	S79	Methods	NEG	Correlation analysis was carried out with Pearson’s calculations.
SEMI	NEG	PMC5335791.xml	S80	Methods	NEG	Values with a p < 0.05 were considered to be statistically significant (*p < 0.05, **p < 0.01, ***p < 0.001).
SEMI	NEG	PMC5339547.xml	S40	Background	NEG	Over the last 5 years several countries have produced guidelines for the identification and management of adults and children with FH.1 12–15
SEMI	NEG	PMC5339547.xml	S45	Background	NEG	In a randomised controlled trial of the use of pravastatin, further change in CIMT was prevented.20
SEMI	NEG	PMC5339547.xml	S107	Discussion	NEG	While some families may not have consented to a genetic test, the reason for not performing a genetic test in children is primarily due to the lack of availability/funding of such tests in some parts of the country.
SEMI	NEG	PMC5339547.xml	S119	Discussion	NEG	One of the limitations of the Register is that by its nature it is an opportunistic sample and is likely to be biased to children with HeFH from more severely affected families than HeFH children in the general population.
SEMI	NEG	PMC5339556.xml	S56	Methods	NEG	10.1136/archdischild-2016-310760.supp1
SEMI	NEG	PMC5339556.xml	S102	Results	NEG	No statistically significant effect modification by caesarean section, administration of antibiotics to the mother during vaginal delivery, birth weight <2500 g, ≥1 sibling, atopic disposition, age at vaccination ≤2 days, maternal BCG vaccination and BCG vaccine batch was observed (table 3).
SEMI	POS	PMC5339556.xml	S111	Discussion	POS	The study may be limited by our choice of all-cause hospitalisation as primary outcome, which was chosen because of its potentially high impact on public health and because this outcome included both hospitalisation-requiring infections and severe manifestations of atopic disease.
SEMI	POS	PMC5339556.xml	S112	Discussion	POS	Given the high incidence of hospitalisations, this outcome, however, may not have been specific enough to detect a potential beneficial immune-training effect of BCG.
SEMI	NEG	PMC5339561.xml	S12	Objective	NEG	Girls in the poorest income quintile were twice as likely (OR=2.1), and the second poorest quintile nearly twice as likely (OR=1.9) to have begun menstruation compared with girls in the richest income quintile.
SEMI	NEG	PMC5339561.xml	S29	Introduction	NEG	Prior studies, mostly from the USA, have described socioeconomic and ethnic/racial patterning of the onset of puberty.9–14
SEMI	NEG	PMC5339561.xml	S36	Introduction	NEG	The accurate estimation of different stages of puberty, particularly in population surveys, is challenging.
SEMI	NEG	PMC5339561.xml	S65	Methods	NEG	BMI and FMI were used in statistical models as markers of adiposity.
SEMI	NEG	PMC5339561.xml	S87	Results	NEG	The average age of girls was 11.2 years (SD=0.33) and 9.5% had begun menstruation.
SEMI	NEG	PMC5339561.xml	S99	Results	NEG	In fully adjusted models, differences remained statistically significant for Bangladeshi and black African girls (model 5: Bangladeshi, OR=2.15; black African, OR=1.87).
SEMI	NEG	PMC5339561.xml	S100	Results	NEG	Similar patterns of attenuation were observed when using FMI in models, but differences were no longer statistically different for the black African group (see online supplementary appendix table 2).
SEMI	NEG	PMC5339561.xml	S110	Discussion	NEG	There are important differences to note here though, as the Ten Towns study found no differences according to social position or ethnicity.
SEMI	POS	PMC5339561.xml	S125	Discussion	POS	On the other hand, our study has limitations.
SEMI	POS	PMC5339561.xml	S126	Discussion	POS	Girls’ menstruation was obtained from mother reports, this method of ascertainment has been reported to be reliable elsewhere,13 with no evidence of cultural or socioeconomic bias in the reporting of menarche.
SEMI	POS	PMC5339561.xml	S127	Discussion	POS	However, this cannot be entirely ruled out as even though the overall amount of missing data was small, there was some variation in the proportion of study participants in the ‘don't know/don't wish to answer’ category.
SEMI	POS	PMC5339561.xml	S128	Discussion	POS	As already noted we were able to investigate two hypothesised pathways and while our markers of adiposity were objectively measured, markers of the psychosocial environment were reported by the mother and could be prone to bias.
SEMI	POS	PMC5339561.xml	S129	Discussion	POS	There were a wider set of puberty markers available for use—breast development and pubic hair growth, but the reliability of these in population study settings is questionable and we chose not to use them.
SEMI	POS	PMC5339561.xml	S130	Discussion	POS	Due to lack of data we were not able to investigate the potential role of environmental pollutants.
SEMI	POS	PMC5339561.xml	S131	Discussion	POS	Nor were we able to examine the potential role of migration as all study participants were born in the UK; we did run analyses including mothers' migration status but this did not alter model estimates and had no independent relationship to menstruation in their daughters.
SEMI	POS	PMC5339561.xml	S132	Discussion	POS	Finally due to lack of data we were not able to take account of any heritable portion of early puberty.
SEMI	POS	PMC5339561.xml	S133	Discussion	POS	Taken together these limitations of data availability and imperfect measurement of environmental factors might help shed light on apparent economic and ethnic inequalities that remained after adiposity and psychosocial factors were taken account of.
SEMI	NEG	PMC5339561.xml	S140	Conclusions	NEG	Given the short-term and long-term implications for early puberty on women's health and well-being, improving our understanding of underlying processes could help identify opportunities for interventions with benefits across the life course.
SEMI	NEG	PMC5340000.xml	S26	Background	NEG	Because patients with IPF usually have had a computed tomography (CT) scan, both qualitative and quantitative CT measurements have also been studied to determine their associations with PFT measures and clinical outcomes [4–15].
SEMI	NEG	PMC5340000.xml	S48	Methods	NEG	For the densitometric evaluation, the histogram of distribution of the density of each voxel within the lung was plotted as shown in Fig. 1, and the skewness, kurtosis, and the mean of that distribution (mean lung density, MLD) were measured.
SEMI	NEG	PMC5340000.xml	S59	Methods	NEG	The same CT images used for the objective analysis were reviewed by two experts and the percentage of lung occupied by fibrotic disease (reticular and honeycombing) was qualitatively defined as described previously [16, 24].
SEMI	NEG	PMC5340000.xml	S129	Discussion	NEG	Of particular note are the sample size, which limited our ability to adjust for other covariates in the mortality models, and the disease severity based both on the percentages of interstitial disease and the high rates of death and transplant, which potentially limit generalizability to those patients with less severe disease.
SEMI	NEG	PMC5340423.xml	S43	Patients and methods	NEG	Infants were withdrawn from the trial if severe adverse effects developed or parents withdrew the consent.
SEMI	NEG	PMC5340423.xml	S66	Patients and methods	NEG	Assessment of Hb levels was the primary objective, whereas, the secondary objectives included assessment of RBC count, mean corpuscular volume (MCV), serum iron (SI), transferrin saturation (TS), ferritin, the percentage of reticulocyte count (RET), total iron binding capacity (TIBC), and malondialdehyde (MDA) and superoxide dismutase (SOD) at baseline and 2 weeks after supplementation.
SEMI	NEG	PMC5340423.xml	S74	Patients and methods	NEG	The data was analyzed using SPSS 21.0 for the Windows software, and the results are expressed as mean ± SD (x ± s) or median and interquartile range.
SEMI	NEG	PMC5340423.xml	S115	Discussion	NEG	Two studies had shown that intravenous iron therapy can reduce the number of blood transfusions, and the amount of EPO needed.[14,15]
SEMI	NEG	PMC5340424.xml	S22	Introduction	NEG	Nonsurvivors had lower eGFR and higher NGAL, which predicted the 30-day mortality.
SEMI	NEG	PMC5340424.xml	S48	Materials and Methods	NEG	Sepsis was defined as proven or suspected infections and the presence of 2 or more systemic inflammatory response syndrome criteria.
SEMI	NEG	PMC5340424.xml	S62	Materials and Methods	NEG	Finally, we plotted the cumulative Kaplan–Meier survival curves of the selected time-to-event outcomes, including dialysis dependence, CKD, and all-cause mortality, and performed the log-rank test to compare group differences.
SEMI	NEG	PMC5340424.xml	S80	Results	NEG	A total of 1716 (22.6%) patients died before discharge, of which 1515 (21.0%) and 201 (54.0%) were in the non-AKI and AKI groups, respectively (Table 3).
SEMI	POS	PMC5340424.xml	S119	Limitations	POS	This study has several limitations.
SEMI	POS	PMC5340424.xml	S120	Limitations	POS	First, the NHIRD did not include data on clinical factors, such as serum Cr.
SEMI	POS	PMC5340424.xml	S121	Limitations	POS	Thus, AKI staging and CKD severity were not provided.
SEMI	POS	PMC5340424.xml	S122	Limitations	POS	However, previous studies have reported the accuracy and admissibility of AKI and CKD diagnoses in the NHIRD, and the accuracy of CIC registration in the NHIRD has also been validated.
SEMI	NEG	PMC5340425.xml	S42	Materials and methods	NEG	In accordance with Apulian Regional Laws, permission from the Ethics Committee to carry out this study was not necessary given that both data and sera from patients were collected for routine diagnostic testing.
SEMI	NEG	PMC5340425.xml	S45	Materials and methods	NEG	A physician explained the aim of the study to blood donors; a written informed consent was requested and obtained from blood donors who accepted to participate in the survey.
SEMI	NEG	PMC5340425.xml	S63	Results	NEG	The proportion of positive subjects was similar both in females (n = 259/407; 63.6%; 95% CI = 58.9 – 68.2) and in males (n = 913/1420; 64.3%; 95% CI = 61.8 – 66.7; chi-square = 0.06; P = 0.807).
SEMI	NEG	PMC5340425.xml	S82	Discussion	NEG	The collected data showed that this product is immunogenic in more than 90% of people vaccinated with a single dose, and more of 95% of those who received the full course.
SEMI	NEG	PMC5340426.xml	S19		NEG	With an estimated 746,000 deaths in 2012, liver cancer is the second most common cancer-related deaths, worldwide.[4]
SEMI	NEG	PMC5340426.xml	S39		NEG	A retrospective, cross-sectional study of the SEER-Medicare database files (Patient Entitlement and Diagnosis Summary File [PEDSF] for identifying HCC cases via linkage Medicare DENOM file for those who identified as a SEER case, further, DENOM linked Medicare Provider Analysis and Review file [MEDPAR], outpatient file, and Physician/Supplier bills file [NCH]) were used for this analysis between 2001 and 2009.
SEMI	NEG	PMC5340426.xml	S84		NEG	Also, 73% of HCC patients who received LT had HCV infection and 12% had alcoholic liver disease.
SEMI	NEG	PMC5340426.xml	S102		NEG	In fact, after exclusion of these cases, the mortality within 2 years of diagnosis was similar between patients who received liver transplantation (25%) and surgical resection (34%, P value proportion = 0.85) as well as survival (P value log-rank = 0.25, Fig. 1).
SEMI	NEG	PMC5340427.xml	S6	Abstract	NEG	Moreover, HFCWO may influence ventilator settings by the vigorous oscillation.
SEMI	NEG	PMC5340427.xml	S7	Abstract	NEG	The aim of this study was to investigate these issues.
SEMI	NEG	PMC5340427.xml	S25	Introduction	NEG	Cough function is paramount for expectoration; however, coughing is not practical for acute pneumonic patients with respiratory failure receiving endotracheal intubation, mechanical ventilation, and sedation.[1]
SEMI	NEG	PMC5340427.xml	S29	Introduction	NEG	High-frequency chest wall oscillation (HFCWO), mimicking a “mini-cough” by compressing and relaxing the chest wall to generate an oscillated volume from the lungs, can dislodge airway secretions as efficiently as CCPT[4,9,10] and can therefore save manpower to conduct CCPT.[11]
SEMI	NEG	PMC5340427.xml	S32	Introduction	NEG	Although measurement of immediate cardiopulmonary changes in patients receiving HFCWO is more explicit and practical than lung function and BODE score, the measurement has not been studied in patients receiving mechanical ventilation.
SEMI	NEG	PMC5340427.xml	S38	Methods	NEG	The participants were randomly allocated to the study group or the control group on a 1:1 ratio using a computer-generated randomization schedule.
SEMI	NEG	PMC5340427.xml	S39	Methods	NEG	Adult subjects with pneumonia complicated with acute respiratory failure requiring endotracheal intubation and mechanical ventilation were consecutively recruited from a medical intensive care unit (ICU) (20-bed capacity).
SEMI	NEG	PMC5340427.xml	S42	Methods	NEG	All of the patients had sufficient sputum production to require the physician to order airway secretion clearance.
SEMI	NEG	PMC5340427.xml	S49	Methods	NEG	The primary investigators (MLC and CYL) were blinded to which procedure the patients received.
SEMI	NEG	PMC5340427.xml	S56	Methods	NEG	HFCWO was performed using a Vest Airway Clearance System Model 105 (Hill-Rom, St.
SEMI	NEG	PMC5340427.xml	S57	Methods	NEG	Paul, MN) connected to a vest via 2 flexible tubes by trained nurses who were blinded to the purpose of the study.
SEMI	NEG	PMC5340427.xml	S61	Methods	NEG	Following HFCWO or CCPT, suction was performed immediately via an endotracheal tube.[15]
SEMI	NEG	PMC5340427.xml	S70	Methods	NEG	The predetermined primary outcome measure was differences in the Ppeak between baseline and 15 minutes after suction.
SEMI	NEG	PMC5340427.xml	S81	Methods	NEG	For non-normal data, the Mann–Whitney U test was used.
SEMI	NEG	PMC5340427.xml	S96	Results	NEG	During CCPT, there were no significant differences in any of the measured variables between the baseline level and the 15th minute of the procedure (Figs. 2–5, all P > 0.05).
SEMI	NEG	PMC5340427.xml	S110	Discussion	NEG	It has been reported that HFCWO may interfere with ventilator performance.[4,23]
SEMI	NEG	PMC5340427.xml	S130	Discussion	NEG	Although Pmean and RSBI were lower after sputum suction than at baseline in the CCPT group, there were no significant differences in these variables compared to the HFCWO group.
SEMI	POS	PMC5340427.xml	S137	Discussion	POS	Although this is a randomized controlled study, there was still enrollment bias.
SEMI	POS	PMC5340427.xml	S138	Discussion	POS	Despite more subjects receiving sedation in the CCPT group than in the HFCWO group, the CCPT group was sedated to a more shallow level.
SEMI	POS	PMC5340427.xml	S139	Discussion	POS	However, the entire CCPT group had poorer consciousness because some of them had lower levels of consciousness because of underlying illness despite receiving less sedation.
SEMI	POS	PMC5340427.xml	S140	Discussion	POS	The poorer consciousness might be the main cause of a steadier cardiopulmonary response during the procedures in the CCPT group than in the HFCWO group.
SEMI	POS	PMC5340427.xml	S141	Discussion	POS	However, Ppeak was lower in the HFCWO group than in the CCPT group after sputum suction, suggesting that sedation use or consciousness level did not affect the main results of the study.
SEMI	POS	PMC5340427.xml	S142	Discussion	POS	Patients were intended to use ventilator on pressure control mode.
SEMI	POS	PMC5340427.xml	S143	Discussion	POS	However, 2 patients of the HFCWO group were used volume control mode.
SEMI	POS	PMC5340427.xml	S144	Discussion	POS	Intent-to-treat analysis was used in this study.
SEMI	POS	PMC5340427.xml	S145	Discussion	POS	Therefore, the 2 patients were not excluded from analysis.
SEMI	POS	PMC5340427.xml	S146	Discussion	POS	This study shows that HFCWO can be safe, but CCPT seems more efficacious for tidal volume before and after sputum suction.
SEMI	POS	PMC5340427.xml	S147	Discussion	POS	However, the changes (Δ) in tidal volume between baseline and after sputum suction for 15 minutes were not significant in either group (Fig. 5), suggesting a larger scale of patient population for this regard is warranted.
SEMI	POS	PMC5340427.xml	S148	Discussion	POS	Another selection bias was a concern that Ppeak was higher at baseline so that Ppeak might be higher at 15 minutes after sputum suction in the CCPT group than the HFCWO group (Fig. 2).
SEMI	POS	PMC5340427.xml	S149	Discussion	POS	However, the difference between groups in ΔPpeak between baseline and recovery from sputum suction for 15 minutes was larger in HFCWO group than in CCPT group (Table 3).
SEMI	POS	PMC5340427.xml	S150	Discussion	POS	Mortality rate was higher in the CCPT group than the HFCWO.
SEMI	POS	PMC5340427.xml	S151	Discussion	POS	This might also be attributed to selection bias as the incidence of multiorgan failure tended to be higher in the CCPT group than in the HFCWO group, although insignificantly.
SEMI	POS	PMC5340427.xml	S152	Discussion	POS	The hospital stay, lung function, or BODE score was not reported, as these were not the foci of the study.
SEMI	POS	PMC5340427.xml	S153	Discussion	POS	Lastly, as this is an observational study exploring many variables, there is a potential risk of finding statistically significant association because of chance.
SEMI	NEG	PMC5340429.xml	S26		NEG	The results of that study showed that during walking with loads on 1 lower extremity the values of the normalized cross-correlation (Ccnorm) were lower than the values found in normal gait.
SEMI	NEG	PMC5340429.xml	S47		NEG	All participants gave written informed consent to take part in this research.
SEMI	NEG	PMC5340429.xml	S78		NEG	The clinical characteristics of the chronic stroke patients and the nondisabled young adults, and also the poststroke fallers and nonfallers were compared using the Fisher exact test for categorical variables and the Mann–Whitney U test for continuous variables.
SEMI	NEG	PMC5340429.xml	S122		NEG	Some limitations of this study must be acknowledged.
SEMI	NEG	PMC5340430.xml	S83	Materials and methods	NEG	The t test for normal distribution and rank-sum test for non-normal distribution were performed.
SEMI	NEG	PMC5340430.xml	S93	Results	NEG	After SsPI enzyme digestion, the PCR products of CYP3A5∗3 were as follows: the wild-type homozygote ∗1/∗1 had 2 SsPI enzyme recognition sites, and the 293 bps was digested into 3 fragments of 148, 125, and 70 bps.
SEMI	NEG	PMC5340430.xml	S99	Results	NEG	And the frequency of ∗1 allele was 96.79% and ∗3 allele was 3.21%.
SEMI	NEG	PMC5340430.xml	S101	Results	NEG	And the frequency of T allele was 61.22%.
SEMI	NEG	PMC5340431.xml	S6	Abstract	NEG	The patients with multisystem involvement usually have a poor prognosis.
SEMI	NEG	PMC5340431.xml	S12	Abstract	NEG	We performed the immunosuppressants to deal with the LCH after LT, now the patient is currently well with normal liver function and no evidence of recurrence of LCH for 4 and a half years follow-up.
SEMI	NEG	PMC5340431.xml	S39	Case report	NEG	Liver histopathology after LT revealed micronodular cirrhosis with SC and positive immunostaining (CD1a and S100), suggestive of LCH involving in the liver (Fig. 2).
SEMI	NEG	PMC5340431.xml	S55	Discussion	NEG	In additional, cyclophosphamide could result in hepatotoxicity by peroxidative damage to normal liver tissue.[5]
SEMI	NEG	PMC5340432.xml	S94	Abstract	NEG	However, seizure syndrome as a first manifestation of TLML-PACNS has rarely reported before.
SEMI	NEG	PMC5340432.xml	S62	Case report	NEG	Intravenous pulse methylprednisolone 1 g daily was given for 3 days, and epileptic seizure symptoms quickly disappeared, subsequently oral prednisone was continued at high dose (1 mg/kg per d) for 4 weeks in combination with cyclophosphamide (CyP) 2 mg/kg per d for a total 6 months.
SEMI	NEG	PMC5340432.xml	S89	Case report	NEG	He was administered with methylprednisolone 1 g daily intravenously for 3 days, then tapered over 25 days to prednisone 30 mg daily by oral administration, and the treatment was maintained for 6 months duration.
SEMI	NEG	PMC5340432.xml	S115	Discussion	NEG	Furthermore, constitutional features, such as fever, were the common concomitant symptom, and the lesion was reduced after several weeks of antibiotic treatment.
SEMI	NEG	PMC5340433.xml	S72	Case report	NEG	To verify the pathophysiological diagnosis, biopsy was performed with an endonasal endoscopic approach, and tissue was taken from the anterior lobe of the pituitary and right petrous bone with mucosa on its surface (Fig. 1E and F).
SEMI	NEG	PMC5340433.xml	S79	Case report	NEG	The sample from the pituitary gland was examined by flow cytometry, showing no proliferative pattern of a specific lineage (data not shown).
SEMI	NEG	PMC5340433.xml	S83	Case report	NEG	MRI revealed size improvement and the normalized enhancement of the pituitary and involved lesion (Fig. 1B).
SEMI	NEG	PMC5340433.xml	S117	Discussion	NEG	Although there have been several clinical case reports of supposed progression of LINH, we think this is the first case that the origin of LINH-combined anterior pituitary dysfunction was elucidated pathologically.
SEMI	NEG	PMC5340436.xml	S7	Abstract	NEG	We aimed to investigate if fluid filtration obtained from forearm and calf measurement site is interchangeable in nonsedated perioperative patients.
SEMI	NEG	PMC5340436.xml	S49	Methods	NEG	Hereafter, strain gauge sensors of the appropriate length were applied ensuring a tight-fitting placement on the skin and a minimum pretension.
SEMI	NEG	PMC5340436.xml	S50	Methods	NEG	The leg was elevated while the heel was supported on a custom-built cushion resulting in knee and hip angles at 90° and a calf position approximately 20 cm above the heart level.
SEMI	NEG	PMC5340436.xml	S77	Methods	NEG	Because of limited sample sizes and nonnormal distributions of the observations, data were expressed as median (25%, 75% quartiles), or frequencies (%), respectively.
SEMI	NEG	PMC5340436.xml	S124	Discussion	NEG	These findings are consistent with previous studies indicating 38% and 39% higher fluid filtration obtained from forearm compared with calf measurement site in healthy volunteers.[10,11]
SEMI	NEG	PMC5340436.xml	S133	Discussion	NEG	It has to be noted that our and former results, which indicated that forearm fluid filtration was higher than calf fluid filtration, were obtained in subjects in supine position.
SEMI	NEG	PMC5340436.xml	S138	Discussion	NEG	Bland–Altman analysis also revealed wide limits of agreement reflecting that the difference of both measurement sites had a large variation around the systemic bias.
SEMI	NEG	PMC5340436.xml	S146	Discussion	NEG	During VCP the patients are requested to remain absolutely still and it has been stated that minimal muscle movement or shivering may impair data acquisition.[9]
SEMI	POS	PMC5340436.xml	S149	Discussion	POS	The study has some limitations.
SEMI	POS	PMC5340436.xml	S150	Discussion	POS	In our study, an approach including a single pressure increase was chosen for VCP, as this approach allows a quick assessment and is therefore well tolerated in wake nonintubated patients during the perioperative course and is feasible during clinical routine on the ward.
SEMI	POS	PMC5340436.xml	S151	Discussion	POS	In this regard, although the assessment of fluid filtration was started after 3 minutes ensuring that at least 90.3% of the RVR were completed, it cannot be excluded that a potential residual RVR might have influenced the results.
SEMI	POS	PMC5340436.xml	S152	Discussion	POS	However, due to the association with edema shown for arm measurement site, a bias by residual RVR is assumed to be unlikely.
SEMI	POS	PMC5340436.xml	S153	Discussion	POS	Furthermore, subjects were female patients with epithelial ovarian cancer undergoing cytoreductive surgery.
SEMI	POS	PMC5340436.xml	S154	Discussion	POS	It cannot be excluded that pelvic surgical procedures may have influenced fluid filtration of the legs.
SEMI	POS	PMC5340436.xml	S155	Discussion	POS	Therefore, conclusions of this study must be limited to this patient group and cannot be presumed to other patient populations.

SEMI	NEG	PMC5340437.xml	S87	Discussion	NEG	Although it might be possible that statins therapy would reduce serum cholesterol level, nevertheless, the serum ALB level (32.7 ± 4.4 g/L) below the normal range (≥ 40 g/L) might also directly indicate that patients in present study were in a malnutritional condition.
SEMI	NEG	PMC5340437.xml	S91	Discussion	NEG	For example, cholesterol on the 1 hand is a major energy resource, and in HF patients, energy-deprivation superimposes hypo-perfusion would promote renal and liver dysfunction which in turn cause HF symptom deterioration.[13]

SEMI	NEG	PMC5340447.xml	S32		NEG	All patients underwent surgical intervention including canaliculotomy with curettage, which was performed by cutting the punctum along the posterior wall with small, straight scissors, and then repressing the canaliculus and removing the concretions completely.
SEMI	NEG	PMC5340447.xml	S86		NEG	To reduce the misdiagnosis, we should know the clinical features of canaliculitis with concretions, but we should also recognize that concretions usually discharge by extruding from the punctum by pressing of the involved canaliculus and not of lacrimal sac compression.[3,8]
SEMI	NEG	PMC5340447.xml	S90		NEG	Therefore, ultrasonic can offer a noninvasive means of identifying concretions and may improve the diagnostic accuracy.[21,22]
SEMI	NEG	PMC5340447.xml	S97		NEG	Conservative therapy such as topical and/or systemics antibiotics, digital massage, corticosteroids, irrigation, syringing, and even curettage by punctum alone, was reported to have a high probability of recurrence among canaliculitis with concretions patients.[1,3,8,10,11]

SEMI	NEG	PMC5340452.xml	S85	Materials and methods	NEG	Multivariate analysis of markers was performed by constructing a logistic regression model, and a new lncRNA score was generated.
SEMI	NEG	PMC5340452.xml	S109	Results	NEG	This discrepancy may be because of false-negative results obtained by performing microarray analysis.
SEMI	NEG	PMC5340452.xml	S117	Results	NEG	ROC curves were constructed based on the above findings, and AUC was generated to assess the diagnostic values of the 3 lncRNAs.
SEMI	NEG	PMC5340452.xml	S166	Discussion	NEG	Based on this finding, we performed ROC analysis to assess the diagnostic values of the 3 lncRNAs.
SEMI	NEG	PMC5340453.xml	S5	Abstract	NEG	All synchronous colorectal cancer patients who underwent surgical treatment were included.
SEMI	NEG	PMC5340453.xml	S66	Results	NEG	The mean age at diagnosis was slightly higher for the synchronous cancers than for the single colorectal cancers (62.3 ± 10.4 vs 59.8 ± 11.1, P = 0.001), and synchronous colorectal cancer was more common in male patients (71.9% vs 61.2%, P = 0.001).
SEMI	NEG	PMC5340453.xml	S88	Results	NEG	Four of the patients who underwent 2 regional resections and 26 of the patients who underwent extensive resection did not receive preoperative colonoscopy or CT colonography because of obstruction; this did not differ significantly between the 2 groups (P = 0.181).
SEMI	NEG	PMC5340453.xml	S109	Discussion	NEG	It might be of concern to most surgeons that postoperative functional outcomes after total proctocolectomy would be poor.
SEMI	NEG	PMC5340453.xml	S120	Discussion	NEG	Our study results showed that there were no differences in complication rate and hospital stay between the 2 regional resection groups and the extensive resection group.
SEMI	POS	PMC5340453.xml	S146	Discussion	POS	The present study had some limitations.
SEMI	POS	PMC5340453.xml	S147	Discussion	POS	First, it was retrospective and there may have been bias in the selection of patients, which is clinically unavoidable.
SEMI	POS	PMC5340453.xml	S148	Discussion	POS	Second, the number of patients who underwent 2 regional resections was small, leaving the results less persuasive.
SEMI	POS	PMC5340453.xml	S149	Discussion	POS	Despite these limitations, our study was met an important need in that there have been few studies on the treatment of synchronous cancer to date.
SEMI	POS	PMC5340453.xml	S150	Discussion	POS	Accordingly, we compared perioperative outcome, occurrence of metachronous cancer, and functional outcomes between the 2 regional resections and extensive resection treatments.
SEMI	NEG	PMC5340454.xml	S56	Case report	NEG	Immunohistochemically, the neuroendocrine markers chromogranin A, synaptophysin, and NSE were limited to the NEC component of the primary tumor (Fig. 2E–G).
SEMI	NEG	PMC5340454.xml	S66	Discussion	NEG	In general, tumors with multiple phenotypic features, regardless of their oncogenesis, are considered to have highly malignant biological behavior.[12]
SEMI	NEG	PMC5340454.xml	S77	Discussion	NEG	In addition, affected LNs demonstrated similar immunohistochemical staining patterns to the primary lesion for chromogranin A, synaptophysin, NSE, and p53.
SEMI	NEG	PMC5340454.xml	S80	Discussion	NEG	However, liver metastases may have contained both well-differentiated carcinomas and poorly differentiated NEC because lymphatic, venous, and perineural invasion were observed in both components of the primary lesion and the presence of each component in affected LNs.
SEMI	NEG	PMC5340455.xml	S26	Methods	NEG	ACSIS is a prospective cohort study and includes all patients with ACS (NSTEMI and STEMI) who were admitted to 26 intensive cardiac care units in Israel from February to March 2000 to 2010 every 2nd year.
SEMI	NEG	PMC5340455.xml	S35	Methods	NEG	Mortality rates at 1-year were derived from hospital charts and by matching patients’ identification number with the Israeli National Population Registry.
SEMI	NEG	PMC5340455.xml	S58	Results	NEG	Patients with severe LV dysfunction were older, and had a significantly higher prevalence of comorbidities, including HTN, DM, congestive heart failure, chronic renal failure, PAD, cerebrovascular disease, and prior IM.
SEMI	NEG	PMC5340455.xml	S65	Results	NEG	In this group, the patients were much older, had higher rate of renal failure, peripheral artery disease, prior congestive heart failure, DM, and prior CVA, and therefore were more prone to receive conservative therapy.
SEMI	NEG	PMC5340455.xml	S73	Results	NEG	This analysis showed that the association between LVEF and 1-year mortality was evident among both STEMI and NSTEMI patients (all P-values for interaction >0.10).
SEMI	NEG	PMC5340455.xml	S75	Results	NEG	This analysis showed that age and admission Killip class were associated with increased risk for 1-year mortality in all LVEF subsets.
SEMI	NEG	PMC5340455.xml	S81	Results	NEG	Consistent with predictors identified in multivariable analysis, Kaplan–Meier survival analysis showed that the association between the presence or absence of ST-segment elevation on admission and the increased 1-year mortality was most prominent among patients with severe LV dysfunction on admission and less prominent among those with mild to moderate and preserved LV function (Fig. 3A and B).
SEMI	NEG	PMC5340455.xml	S107	Discussion	NEG	In this study, in addition to the electrocardiographic and angiographic variables, the presence of insulin-treated DM and renal insufficiency were strong prognostic predictors.[20]
SEMI	POS	PMC5340455.xml	S112	Limitations	POS	ACSIS is an observational study of the current clinical practice in Israel, and each patient is treated according to local policies in each participating center.
SEMI	POS	PMC5340455.xml	S113	Limitations	POS	A core-lab was not utilized as ACSIS is a real-world national survey representing all cardiology departments in Israel.
SEMI	POS	PMC5340455.xml	S114	Limitations	POS	Even though measurements of LVEFs were subjectively obtained in different clinical centers and the timing of LVEF assessment during admission was not strictly controlled; previous studies by our group have shown a clear correlation between subjectively assessed LVEF and prognosis.[12]
SEMI	POS	PMC5340455.xml	S115	Limitations	POS	In addition, we do not have any data about EF prior to discharge or a month later.
SEMI	POS	PMC5340455.xml	S117	Limitations	POS	As this study enrolled only patients admitted to the cardiac care unit/cardiology wards, patients who were admitted to internal medicine departments or died before admission to cardiology departments are not represented in this study.
SEMI	POS	PMC5340455.xml	S118	Limitations	POS	For the same reason a higher than expected proportion of STEMI is reported, so that this finding may not be generalized to ACS patients admitted to other wards.
SEMI	POS	PMC5340455.xml	S119	Limitations	POS	Finally, there is no information regarding the specific cause of death.
SEMI	POS	PMC5340455.xml	S120	Limitations	POS	In addition due to the very small number of patients with Killip class IV, we included all patients with clinical cardiac failure on admission (Killip ≥II) rather than Killip class IV as a covariate in the multivariable models.
SEMI	NEG	PMC5340457.xml	S21	Materials and methods	NEG	Four cases in which a positive diagnosis was made based on the pathological findings of cervical lymph node biopsy were called definitive KFD.
SEMI	NEG	PMC5340457.xml	S26	Materials and methods	NEG	The ten cases of clinical KFD included 8 boys (6–15 years’ old) and 2 girls (11–13 years’ old).
SEMI	NEG	PMC5340457.xml	S43	Results	NEG	Three patients did not demonstrate low SAP levels or a 10% decrease in SAP levels in comparison with SAP levels at the initial visit.
SEMI	NEG	PMC5340457.xml	S60	Discussion	NEG	Low SAP activity could therefore be closely related to the pathogenesis of KFD.
SEMI	POS	PMC5340457.xml	S66	Limitations	POS	The population is too small to draw a general conclusion from.
SEMI	POS	PMC5340457.xml	S67	Limitations	POS	Furthermore, the population was mostly diagnosed with KFD based on clinical findings.
SEMI	POS	PMC5340457.xml	S68	Limitations	POS	Because many diseases should be considered in the differential diagnosis of KFD, clinical KFD diagnosed without excisional biopsy is not as exactly pathologically diagnosed as definite cases.
SEMI	POS	PMC5340457.xml	S69	Limitations	POS	Therefore, the findings from this study should be followed up with a larger study containing more definitive KFD cases.
SEMI	NEG	PMC5340458.xml	S8	Abstract	NEG	Time taken to complete the 10-meter Walk Test under various conditions, including walking alone, walking while completing a cognitive task, and walking while completing a motor task, was recorded, with each condition performed at comfortable as well as maximum walking speeds.
SEMI	NEG	PMC5340458.xml	S12	Abstract	NEG	Individuals with chronic stroke tend to prioritize task accuracy and completion over maintaining walking speed.
SEMI	NEG	PMC5340458.xml	S29	Introduction	NEG	Most stroke-specific studies have only explored the respective impacts of either cognitive or motor tasks on gait performance separately.[11–13]
SEMI	NEG	PMC5340458.xml	S31	Introduction	NEG	Although gait decrements during a cognitive or motor task after stroke are well-documented, the differential effects of motor and cognitive tasks on the comfortable and maximum walking speeds of individuals with chronic stroke have not been investigated.
SEMI	NEG	PMC5340458.xml	S38	Methods	NEG	This was a cross-sectional study conducted in the rehabilitation center at The Hong Kong Polytechnic University.
SEMI	NEG	PMC5340458.xml	S41	Methods	NEG	Statistical significance was set to 5% (alpha level 0.05) and the power to 80% (beta level at 0.2).
SEMI	NEG	PMC5340458.xml	S54	Outcome measurements	NEG	Each subject performed the walk test under 6 task conditions in a randomized order determined by drawing lots to avoid subject bias.
SEMI	NEG	PMC5340458.xml	S57	Outcome measurements	NEG	The 6 test conditions were(1)Condition 1: 10mWT at a comfortable walking speed only.(2)Condition 2: 10mWT at the maximum walking speed only.(3)Condition 3: 10mWT combined with a cognitive task at comfortable walking speed.(4)Condition 4: 10mWT combined with a cognitive task at maximum walking speed.(5)Condition 5: 10mWT combined with a motor task at comfortable walking speed.(6)Condition 6: 10mWT combined with a motor task at maximum walking speed.
SEMI	NEG	PMC5340458.xml	S59	Outcome measurements	NEG	Standardized instructions were given during assessment, “When I say go, walk ‘at your most comfortable speed’ or ‘as fast and as safely as you can’ to the end of the walkway” for the comfortable and maximum speed trials, respectively.
SEMI	NEG	PMC5340458.xml	S65	Outcome measurements	NEG	Subjects were instructed to perform serial subtraction in multiples of 3.[11,12] The additional instruction for the combined cognitive and walking trials was, “Count backward by multiples of three from X,” where X was a random number between 70 and 99 assigned by computer software to avoid any bias in the distribution of numbers.
SEMI	NEG	PMC5340458.xml	S85	Outcome measurements	NEG	All the statistical analyses were conducted using the Statistical Package for the Social Sciences (version 21.0; SPSS Inc, Chicago, IL).
SEMI	NEG	PMC5340458.xml	S100	Discussion	NEG	Flansbjer et al[15] recruited subjects with better walking capacity who could walk at least 300 m with or without an assistive device, whereas our study accepted subjects who could walk at least 14 m independent of an assistive device.
SEMI	NEG	PMC5340458.xml	S126	Discussion	NEG	Dennis et al[11] reported that when walking at maximum speed, their subjects prioritized successful completion of the cognitive task over maintaining maximum walking speed.
SEMI	NEG	PMC5340458.xml	S144	Discussion	NEG	Evidently, these subjects prioritized the cognitive task over the walking task despite being instructed not to do so, and even more so when they tried to walk at maximum speed, thus resulting in a greater speed reduction.
SEMI	NEG	PMC5340458.xml	S145	Discussion	NEG	Serial subtractions are not, of course, a realistic voluntary task while walking, especially when compared to walking while holding a cup of water.
SEMI	NEG	PMC5340458.xml	S146	Discussion	NEG	This difference may have encouraged the subjects to be partial to the additional task that was more “natural” and consistent with their activities of daily living, which in this case, was the motor task rather than the cognitive task.
SEMI	POS	PMC5340458.xml	S149	Discussion	POS	The subjects recruited in our study were active members of local self-help groups.
SEMI	POS	PMC5340458.xml	S150	Discussion	POS	They had reasonably good cognitive and motor abilities and were motivated to participate.
SEMI	POS	PMC5340458.xml	S151	Discussion	POS	Cognitive functions and rehabilitation and health are dependent on social income, environment, medical care, and physical activities.[35]
SEMI	POS	PMC5340458.xml	S152	Discussion	POS	These factors were not fully examined during this study to determine confounding factors; this should be examined in further studies.
SEMI	POS	PMC5340458.xml	S153	Discussion	POS	Our subjects may also be physically active, which studies have shown to have a positive influence on cognitive function by stimulating neurogenesis and benefit brain plasticity in older populations.[36–38]
SEMI	POS	PMC5340458.xml	S154	Discussion	POS	However, the complexities and mechanism of neurobiological rehabilitation may be better understood in further studies.[39,40]
SEMI	POS	PMC5340458.xml	S155	Discussion	POS	Our results may not apply to individuals with poorer cognitive or motor functioning.
SEMI	POS	PMC5340458.xml	S156	Discussion	POS	The population studied here could have been more evenly distributed to ensure that there was no sex bias.
SEMI	POS	PMC5340458.xml	S157	Discussion	POS	Moreover, the study was conducted in a controlled environment, and hence, the results may not be readily transferable to a community setting.
SEMI	POS	PMC5340458.xml	S158	Discussion	POS	This study examined only the subjects’ walking speeds, not their gaits quality.
SEMI	POS	PMC5340458.xml	S159	Discussion	POS	Further studies could apply computerized gait analysis to measure the temporal and spatial parameters objectively.
SEMI	POS	PMC5340458.xml	S160	Discussion	POS	Although the cognitive task employed in this study was derived from those used in previous studies, it probably did not realistically represent the distractions affecting those with chronic stroke.
SEMI	POS	PMC5340458.xml	S161	Discussion	POS	Further studies with more realistic cognitive tasks and in a community setting are warranted.
SEMI	POS	PMC5340458.xml	S162	Discussion	POS	The serial subtraction task used here is related to the working memory domain of cognitive functioning.
SEMI	POS	PMC5340458.xml	S163	Discussion	POS	Performing working memory tasks has been reported to discriminate effectively between fallers and nonfallers better than performance in other domains of cognitive functioning.[41]
SEMI	POS	PMC5340458.xml	S164	Discussion	POS	Further studies incorporating working memory tasks with walking might be able to define an optimum protocol as an intervention for individuals with chronic stroke.
SEMI	NEG	PMC5340459.xml	S6	Abstract	NEG	All of the patients with gastric submucosal eminence lesions who underwent ESD from June 2008 to June 2015 in General Hospital, Tianjin Medical University, China, were identified, and patients with GA, which was confirmed by pathological evaluation, were enrolled for further analysis.

SEMI	NEG	PMC5340459.xml	S25	Introduction	NEG	Endoscopic submucosal dissection (ESD) has served a critical role in en bloc resection of eminence lesions, which is derived from submucosal and even muscularis propria.[14–16]
SEMI	NEG	PMC5340459.xml	S36	Methods	NEG	Demographics, clinical symptoms, pathological characteristics, prognosis, complications, and follow-ups were also reviewed.
SEMI	NEG	PMC5340459.xml	S46	Methods	NEG	Using a hook knife or a hybrid knife (JET2, ERBE), the submucosa beneath the lesion was then dissected gradually until the lesion was exposed.
SEMI	NEG	PMC5340459.xml	S47	Methods	NEG	To make sure the entire lesions were removed macroscopically, the connective tissue surrounding the lesion was dissected carefully.
SEMI	NEG	PMC5340459.xml	S74	Results	NEG	A total of 15 (2.63%, 15/571) patients were diagnosed as GA with unclear diagnosis before the procedure.
SEMI	NEG	PMC5340459.xml	S77	Results	NEG	According to the EUS before ESD procedure, the mean size of GA was (1.47 ± 0.67) cm (range 0.4–3.0 cm), and the lesions of 14 patients originated from submucosa and 1 originated from superficial muscularis.
SEMI	NEG	PMC5340459.xml	S122	Discussion	NEG	In addition, there seems to be a lack of evidence regarding the optimal strategy in SMTs with a negative EUS-FNA tissue diagnosis, so more prospective trials are urgently needed to answer this question.
SEMI	POS	PMC5340459.xml	S123	Discussion	POS	Although the results indicated that ESD could be employed to treat GA without recurrence or metastasis in a long time follow-up, our study still had some limitations.
SEMI	POS	PMC5340459.xml	S124	Discussion	POS	First, these case series were from one single center and included a relative small number of cases because of the rare prevalence.
SEMI	POS	PMC5340459.xml	S125	Discussion	POS	Second, all of the lesions were <3 cm in maximum diameter in our study.
SEMI	POS	PMC5340459.xml	S126	Discussion	POS	Although several studies reported good prognosis of GAs that lager than 3 cm, all of them were treated via surgery but not ESD.[3,11,13,24,25]
SEMI	POS	PMC5340459.xml	S127	Discussion	POS	Whether the large lesions have a higher risk of malignant transformation is still unknown, so the therapeutic effect of ESD for lager GAs needs further evaluation in the future studies.
SEMI	POS	PMC5340459.xml	S128	Discussion	POS	In addition, ESD for GA might be a less complicated and less hazardous option, and offer a minimally invasive approach compared to surgery, especially for the patients cannot withstand surgery.
SEMI	POS	PMC5340459.xml	S129	Discussion	POS	Third, ESD for SMTs is controversial, owing to the potential risk of leaving behind residual tissue.
SEMI	POS	PMC5340459.xml	S130	Discussion	POS	In our study, the majority of small SMTs were preoperatively diagnosed as benign tumors, so the patients tended to choose ESD treatment instead of surgery.
SEMI	POS	PMC5340459.xml	S131	Discussion	POS	Although ESD for SMTs is not widely recognized with the potential risk of residual tissue, no recurrence is found during our follow-up period.
SEMI	POS	PMC5340459.xml	S132	Discussion	POS	Fourth, our primary measure of efficacy was endoscopic en bloc (i.e., one-piece) and histological diagnosis by pathologists based on the current references because the exact margins of lesions cannot be measured.
SEMI	POS	PMC5340459.xml	S133	Discussion	POS	However, long-term outcomes and recurrence should be further evaluated.
SEMI	NEG	PMC5340460.xml	S12	Abstract	NEG	The highest number of adverse events occurred in group 2.0, including vocal cord rigidity, hypotension, and bradycardia.
SEMI	NEG	PMC5340460.xml	S20	Introduction	NEG	However, in circumstances such as surgery of very short duration, a rapid return of spontaneous ventilation is required.
SEMI	NEG	PMC5340460.xml	S74	Methods	NEG	To calculate the regression models allowing the prediction of the effective concentration of sevoflurane for successful intubation in 50% (EC50) and 95% (EC95) of the patients, an isotonic regression using the pooled adjacent violators algorithm (PAVA) was performed for each group.
SEMI	NEG	PMC5340460.xml	S99	Discussion	NEG	The results of this study showed that the concentration of sevoflurane required to perform intubation without neuromuscular blockade decreased as the bolus dose of remifentanil increased.
SEMI	NEG	PMC5340460.xml	S112	Discussion	NEG	We studied 3 different bolus doses of remifentanil in combination with sevoflurane inhalation.
SEMI	NEG	PMC5340460.xml	S125	Discussion	NEG	This seems to be related to the muscle rigidity following a high dose of remifentanil.[24,25]
SEMI	POS	PMC5340460.xml	S140	Discussion	POS	This study has several limitations.
SEMI	POS	PMC5340460.xml	S141	Discussion	POS	Though we simulated that the brain concentration of sevoflurane could be obtained in 390 s using our method, more accurate brain concentration could be achieved if we were able to maintain the concentration for a longer period of time.
SEMI	POS	PMC5340460.xml	S142	Discussion	POS	However, applying sevoflurane for a longer period of time was not feasible in clinical practice.
SEMI	POS	PMC5340460.xml	S143	Discussion	POS	Furthermore, it was also important to present a feasible model to obtain the target sevoflurane concentration in the brain during the induction period which is easy to apply in actual clinical practice.
SEMI	POS	PMC5340460.xml	S144	Discussion	POS	In addition, because we only included male patients aged 18 to 30 years with ASA physical status I in this study, it is uncertain whether these results could be appropriately generalized to patients of other ages and with comorbidities.

SEMI	NEG	PMC5340462.xml	S95	Results	NEG	The combined approach failed to achieve sufficient neural decompression in 7 cases and these patients required more extensive laminatomy or facetectomy to weaken the support from the pars interarticularis.
SEMI	POS	PMC5340462.xml	S163	Conclusion	POS	The most significant limitations of this study were its retrospective design and low number of cases.
SEMI	POS	PMC5340462.xml	S164	Conclusion	POS	However, it was clear that early postoperative pain was a reason for dissatisfaction in our cases.
SEMI	POS	PMC5340462.xml	S165	Conclusion	POS	The lack of measurement of annular defects in cases who underwent fragmentectomy using the combined approach was another limitation of this study.

SEMI	POS	PMC5348159.xml	S83	Discussion	POS	The study included only men with limited age range, and the ultrasound-estimation was performed at one reference site.
SEMI	POS	PMC5348159.xml	S84	Discussion	POS	However, the estimation of the reference nerve values for a particular gender and age group at a specific site provide specific information to the clinicians.

SEMI	NEG	PMC5348161.xml	S77	Discussion	NEG	The Swenson procedure reduces postoperative obstructive symptoms better than a Soave procedure.[12,14]
SEMI	NEG	PMC5348161.xml	S79	Discussion	NEG	The transanal pullthrough Swenson procedure also has the advantage of a minimized surgical trauma thereby ensuring faster recovery.
SEMI	NEG	PMC5348161.xml	S103	Discussion	NEG	This helps to preserve more sensitivity of the bowel wall at the region close to the anus.[16]
SEMI	NEG	PMC5348161.xml	S110	Discussion	NEG	The prognosis of this group of patients was better when compared to the group of children who underwent transabdominal operations.

SEMI	NEG	PMC5348162.xml	S90	Discussion	NEG	As a result, with a median follow-up of 3 years, the 2-year DFS was 90% (97% stage I), significantly higher than the historical control of 76% in resected early-stage EGFR-mutant NSCLC.
SEMI	NEG	PMC5348162.xml	S120	Discussion	NEG	Unfortunately, this drug has not yet been approved for patients in China.

SEMI	NEG	PMC5348164.xml	S72	Results	NEG	For patients with than without above-normal IgG levels, the time since the VL had become undetectable was shorter (P = 0.02) and a sub-Saharan African background more frequent (P = 0.001) (Table 2).
SEMI	POS	PMC5348164.xml	S95	Discussion	POS	We acknowledge its relatively limited sample size, which is nonetheless in the range of that of previous similar studies, and we believe that it allowed for obtaining reliable estimates.
SEMI	POS	PMC5348164.xml	S96	Discussion	POS	The lack of follow-up precludes determining whether an autoimmune disease eventually develops in some patients with AAbs, but this situation would not have altered our main conclusions.
SEMI	NEG	PMC5348164.xml	S98	Discussion	NEG	Most importantly, the AAbs we found in this context were generally not clinically relevant, which implies that the diagnostic specificity of these clinically relevant AAbs remains intact in HIV-infected patients.
SEMI	NEG	PMC5348165.xml	S12		NEG	Although recurrent CDI did not increase the risk of death, it was associated with a far higher risk of rehospitalization, excess hospital days, and costs to Medicare.
SEMI	NEG	PMC5348165.xml	S15		NEG	One of the most challenging aspects in the care of patients with Clostridium difficile infection (CDI) is its potential to recur.
SEMI	NEG	PMC5348165.xml	S18		NEG	Older age represents a well-established risk factor for developing CDI.[5–9]
SEMI	NEG	PMC5348165.xml	S20		NEG	Due to age and frailty, the elderly are more prone than the young to come in contact with a nursing home (NH), where the overall prevalence of a CDI diagnosis is 2.1% and rates of asymptomatic carriage of toxigenic C. difficile are nearly 50%.[10,11]
SEMI	NEG	PMC5348165.xml	S24		NEG	Furthermore, to the best of our knowledge no study has examined the risk of recurrence specifically in this group.
SEMI	NEG	PMC5348165.xml	S26		NEG	Therefore, we examined the frequency of recurrent CDI and its relationship with hospitalization, mortality, and costs in a group of NH residents who have survived an incident episode of hospitalization with CDI.
SEMI	NEG	PMC5348165.xml	S52		NEG	CDI recurrence was defined by one of the following occurring within 60 days from index discharge or of the last day of incident CDI treatment in the NH: 1.
SEMI	NEG	PMC5348165.xml	S54		NEG	An ICD-9-CM code for CDI (008.45) during a repeat hospitalization.
SEMI	NEG	PMC5348165.xml	S61		NEG	We examined rehospitalization rates within 30 days of a recurrence, time to rehospitalization, hospital length of stay (LOS) and costs (measured as Medicare payments in $US) for the initial postrecurrence rehospitalization, and 60-day mortality in patients with recurrent CDI compared to those without (Fig. 1).
SEMI	NEG	PMC5348165.xml	S80		NEG	Those with and without a recurrence were similar in age, gender, and race/ethnicity (Table 1).
SEMI	NEG	PMC5348165.xml	S103		NEG	Of these, 9.3% suffered death within 30 days of recurrence.
SEMI	NEG	PMC5348165.xml	S112		NEG	Patients with a recurrence (85%) were approximately twice as likely as those without (41%) to require a rehospitalization within 180 days following their initial bout of CDI.
SEMI	NEG	PMC5348165.xml	S125		NEG	Finally, Dubberke et al[23] in a single center cohort study of general hospital population reported the costs attributable to recurrent CDI over 180 days to be ∼$11,000.
SEMI	POS	PMC5348165.xml	S128		POS	Our study has a number of limitations.
SEMI	POS	PMC5348165.xml	S129		POS	As a retrospective study it is subject to a number of biases, most notably selection bias.
SEMI	POS	PMC5348165.xml	S130		POS	To mitigate this we developed a priori inclusion criteria.
SEMI	POS	PMC5348165.xml	S131		POS	Because we used administrative coding to identify incident CDI, there is a threat of misclassification, though this method of identifying CDI is well validated in the hospitalized population.[24]
SEMI	POS	PMC5348165.xml	S132		POS	One clue to the extent that it is present is the fact that toxic megacolon, a complication specific to CDI, was not confined to the CDI group, and occurred, albeit with a lower frequency, among non-CDI patients.
SEMI	POS	PMC5348165.xml	S133		POS	However, such misclassification likely biased our results toward the null.
SEMI	POS	PMC5348165.xml	S134		POS	Using the ICD-9-CM code for detection of recurrent CDI is potentially thornier, as this code may or may not signify the actual presence of active CDI.
SEMI	POS	PMC5348165.xml	S135		POS	Wen et al,[25] in a validations study exploring ways to identify CDI recurrence in administrative datasets, reported a relatively low specificity and, consequently, positive predictive value of a combination of ICD-9 codes, stool-testing procedure codes, and CDI treatment codes for recurrent CDI.
SEMI	POS	PMC5348165.xml	S136		POS	This raises the possibility that a substantial proportion of those identified as CDI recurrence were, in fact, related to the history of CDI rather than an active infection.
SEMI	POS	PMC5348165.xml	S137		POS	The extent of this misclassification is difficult to estimate, as the nature of our study design (all US hospitals as opposed to two academic urban centers) and population (elderly patients discharged to an NH after a CDI hospitalization versus all ages followed in the outpatient clinics affiliated with the academic centers) may invalidate comparisons.
SEMI	POS	PMC5348165.xml	S138		POS	Using the MDS dataset to identify CDI presented its own challenges.
SEMI	POS	PMC5348165.xml	S139		POS	Because the current version of MDS does not explicitly list CDI as an entity, we had to develop an algorithm to identify CDI recurrence.
SEMI	POS	PMC5348165.xml	S140		POS	Although this algorithm has never been validated, by requiring CDI-specific treatment or a rehospitalization with the principal diagnosis of CDI we attempted to increase the specificity of case identification.
SEMI	POS	PMC5348165.xml	S141		POS	However, misclassification may have led to underestimation of the rate of recurrence.
SEMI	POS	PMC5348165.xml	S142		POS	A source of additional potential misclassification relates to our inability to identify either the dose or the duration of treatment of the incident CDI episode, and, thus, inadequately treated cases may have contributed to recurrence.
SEMI	POS	PMC5348165.xml	S143		POS	However, this mimics closely the potential impact of under-treatment on recurrence in real-world clinical practice.
SEMI	NEG	PMC5348165.xml	S149		NEG	At the same time, it is possible that the null mortality result is explained at least in part by this high risk of misclassification.
SEMI	NEG	PMC5348165.xml	S153		NEG	It is, however, possible that they preceded its occurrence.
SEMI	NEG	PMC5348165.xml	S155		NEG	However, our definitions, and specifically that of recurrent CDI, require further validation in a clinical dataset that resembles population examined here.
SEMI	NEG	PMC5348166.xml	S9	Abstract	NEG	Moreover, the patients in lateral LNM positive group exhibited significantly higher rates of tumor recurrence or metastasis than the patients in lateral LNM negative group (P = 0.027).
SEMI	NEG	PMC5348166.xml	S29	Patients and methods	NEG	Patients who underwent additional lateral LND after thyroidectomy were also excluded from this study.
SEMI	NEG	PMC5348166.xml	S33	Patients and methods	NEG	Reported characteristics of suspicious LNMs were a diameter greater than 10 mm, a hypoechoic pattern, an irregular cystic appearance, internal calcification, and increased anteroposterior diameter.
SEMI	NEG	PMC5348166.xml	S119	Discussion	NEG	Second, this study may also be limited by its retrospective design, the limited number of PTMC cases, and analysis of a single center.
SEMI	NEG	PMC5348167.xml	S20		NEG	Moreover, long-term suppression of HBV can lead to regression of fibrosis and cirrhosis in patients with chronic HBV infection.[4,5]
SEMI	NEG	PMC5348167.xml	S21		NEG	HBV infection shows no direct cytopathology in infected hepatocytes, both hepatic cell damage and viral control are immune-mediated.[6,7]
SEMI	NEG	PMC5348167.xml	S69		NEG	Skewed TRBV gene families were identified by GMSP profile and classified into 3 kinds: oligoclonal, monoclonal, and multiclonal expansion (not skewed).
SEMI	NEG	PMC5348167.xml	S147		NEG	Therefore, these characteristic TRBVs and relative CDR3 motif may be relevant to HBeAg SC or non-SC of CHB patients during TDF treatment and could help to explore the TRBV repertoire (using high-throughput sequencing) in CHB patients with antiviral treatment.[33,34]
SEMI	NEG	PMC5348168.xml	S83	Materials and methods	NEG	T tests of paired sample indexes are used for the comparison of indexes are different time points.
SEMI	NEG	PMC5348168.xml	S84	Materials and methods	NEG	Bivariate correlation analysis is used for the analysis of SF-MPQ, NIH-CPSI, and HAD.
SEMI	NEG	PMC5348168.xml	S85	Materials and methods	NEG	Pearson analysis is used to calculate the correlation coefficient.
SEMI	NEG	PMC5348168.xml	S143	Discussion	NEG	This result indicated that alpha-blockers could relieve the symptoms of CP/CPPS to some degree, but the therapeutic effect was not significant.
SEMI	POS	PMC5348168.xml	S167	Discussion	POS	This study also has limitations.
SEMI	POS	PMC5348168.xml	S168	Discussion	POS	First, the samples were small in the 3 groups, which may have had adverse effects on the determination of results.
SEMI	POS	PMC5348168.xml	S169	Discussion	POS	Second, a placebo group was not established because of patient compliance and ethical constraints in 6 months in real clinical practice, which might have a certain bias on the interpretation and safety assessment.
SEMI	POS	PMC5348168.xml	S170	Discussion	POS	Previous studies have shown that the efficiency of placebo in CP/CPPS is up to 30%,[19] and the effective rate in the sertraline and duloxetine groups in this study was >30%, which confirmed the effectiveness of the treatment.
SEMI	NEG	PMC5348169.xml	S17	Abstract	NEG	Surgical excision may be helpful if no improvement was achieved via antibiotic treatment.

SEMI	NEG	PMC5348169.xml	S88	Conclusion	NEG	Clinical awareness of P aeruginosa infection in previously healthy children should be increased.
SEMI	NEG	PMC5348169.xml	S89	Conclusion	NEG	Surgical excision may be helpful if no improvement was achieved with respect to the lesions in the process of conventional antibiotic treatment, since extended course of the antibiotic treatment was not effective in our case.
SEMI	NEG	PMC5348170.xml	S22	Introduction	NEG	Similarly, as the tumor size increases, the chance of locating in different hepatic sections for the single HCC also increases.
SEMI	NEG	PMC5348170.xml	S80	Results	NEG	Similarly, more patients in group DS needed intraoperative blood transfusion than those in group SS (7.9% vs 2.9%, P = 0.038).
SEMI	NEG	PMC5348170.xml	S126	Discussion	NEG	Furthermore, some studies showed that the elderly patients with HCC possibly had a better OS and/or RFS than that of the younger patients.[33,34]
SEMI	NEG	PMC5348170.xml	S130	Discussion	NEG	However, well-designed, long-term, randomized, controlled, prospective trials are still necessary to further confirm this new point proposed in this study.
SEMI	NEG	PMC5348171.xml	S6	Abstract	NEG	64 eyes of 43 central keratoconus patients whose highest power of the cornea located in the central 3 mm zone and 24 eyes of 16 paracentral keratoconus patients whose highest power located out of the central 3 mm zone received standard corneal CXL were included.

SEMI	NEG	PMC5348172.xml	S13	Abstract	NEG	We suggest that loss of E-cadherin expression together with fascin and SALL4 immunopositivity in addition to morphologic features have an impact in differential diagnosis of UCE/DCEs from other high-grade endometrial carcinomas.
SEMI	NEG	PMC5348172.xml	S47	Methods	NEG	For comparison, all markers of the additional panel were also examined in the control group of F3-ECs (n = 11), SCs (n = 11), and CCCs (n = 11) of the endometrium.
SEMI	NEG	PMC5348172.xml	S70	Results	NEG	All patients were postmenopausal, and their ages ranged from 54 to 79 years (mean: 62.5 years; median: 59 years).
SEMI	NEG	PMC5348172.xml	S150	Discussion	NEG	Treatment modalities used in patients with UCE/DCE are very similar to F3-EC in the literature.[4]
SEMI	NEG	PMC5348173.xml	S37	Case reports	NEG	Two fetuses (F1, F2) had a normal fetal heart rate and amniotic fluid (Fig. 1A1).

SEMI	NEG	PMC5348173.xml	S74	Discussion	NEG	It is widely recognized that assisted reproductive technology is associated with multiple pregnancies.[2]
SEMI	NEG	PMC5348173.xml	S75	Discussion	NEG	The fetuses in multiple gestations are vulnerable to various fetal and maternal complications.
SEMI	NEG	PMC5348174.xml	S6	Abstract	NEG	We retrospectively evaluated the values used in home ventilators for patients with ALS, who had maintained a stable level of CO2 on both the arterial blood gas analysis (ABGA) and transcutaneous blood gas monitoring.
SEMI	NEG	PMC5348174.xml	S8	Abstract	NEG	VTi and MV showed a significantly positive correlation with both PBW and ABW of patients in the TPPV group.
SEMI	NEG	PMC5348174.xml	S12	Abstract	NEG	Moreover, it will be helpful to know the differences of setting values between TPPV and NIPPV, especially because ALS patients are usually treated with TPPV due to the initial difficulties associated with NIPPV.
SEMI	NEG	PMC5348174.xml	S15	Introduction	NEG	Respiratory failure due to respiratory muscle dysfunction is a common problem in neuromuscular disease, and respiratory muscle weakness can be reversible, relapsing, or progressive.[1]
SEMI	NEG	PMC5348174.xml	S21	Introduction	NEG	Among the parameters of mechanical ventilation, the tidal volume is one of the more important parameters.
SEMI	NEG	PMC5348174.xml	S22	Introduction	NEG	Over the past decades, the tidal volume of invasive ventilation has progressively decreased, from greater than 12 to 15 mL/kg to less than 9 mL/kg of the actual body weight in patients with acute lung injury/acute respiratory distress syndrome (ALI/ARDS).[6,7]
SEMI	NEG	PMC5348174.xml	S26	Introduction	NEG	As a result, clinicians who are not experts on ventilator settings may experience difficulty in using ventilators, which may lead to inappropriate application.
SEMI	NEG	PMC5348174.xml	S56	Materials and methods	NEG	To develop ventilator equations, a univariate linear regression analysis was used.
SEMI	NEG	PMC5348174.xml	S57	Materials and methods	NEG	VTi and MV were considered as dependent variables, and ABW and PBW, which had the highest Pearson correlation coefficient with VTi and MV, were considered as independent variables.
SEMI	NEG	PMC5348174.xml	S61	Materials and methods	NEG	Statistical analyses were performed using R software 3.1.1.
SEMI	NEG	PMC5348174.xml	S67	Results	NEG	Table 1 shows the demographic and ventilator settings.
SEMI	NEG	PMC5348174.xml	S79	Results	NEG	In the TPPV group, both ABW and PBW had a higher correlation with VTi and MV compared with other parameters (Table 2).
SEMI	NEG	PMC5348174.xml	S101	Discussion	NEG	Although several studies have developed equations to estimate the tidal volume, most of these studies were conducted based on subjects without neuromuscular diseases,[17,18] and there were only a few studies investigating the appropriate ventilator parameters for patients with amyotrophic lateral sclerosis.
SEMI	NEG	PMC5348174.xml	S102	Discussion	NEG	Unlike other neuromuscular diseases, ALS patients with pronounced bulbar symptoms often experience difficulty with NIPPV.
SEMI	NEG	PMC5348174.xml	S112	Discussion	NEG	Therefore, it is important to check not only PIP and VTi, but also VTe or MV.
SEMI	NEG	PMC5348174.xml	S113	Discussion	NEG	As such, in the application process of home ventilators, it may be helpful if a clinician knew in advance of the appropriate tidal volume and MV using these equations, especially in patients with TPPV.
SEMI	NEG	PMC5348174.xml	S117	Discussion	NEG	Since the leakage volume varies widely depending on the facial structures or the severity of the bulbar palsy, it is very difficult to quantify the leakage volume.
SEMI	POS	PMC5348174.xml	S121	Discussion	POS	Our present study had some limitations.
SEMI	POS	PMC5348174.xml	S122	Discussion	POS	First, only a small number of patients with various stages of ALS were included for evaluation.
SEMI	POS	PMC5348174.xml	S123	Discussion	POS	The leakage volume, which is affected by the degree of bulbar palsy, may have influenced our results.
SEMI	POS	PMC5348174.xml	S124	Discussion	POS	However, we tried to reflect the degree of disability by using a modified Ranke scale and by grouping patients based on the the ventilator application methods.
SEMI	POS	PMC5348174.xml	S125	Discussion	POS	Moreover, ALS is relatively rare, and encountering patients with such a disease and receiving ventilator treatment are even rarer.
SEMI	POS	PMC5348174.xml	S126	Discussion	POS	Considering the scarcity of neuromuscular diseases, this study might still be meaningful despite the small number of patients included for evaluation.
SEMI	POS	PMC5348174.xml	S127	Discussion	POS	Further studies that incorporate a greater number of patients with the same disease may be necessary.
SEMI	POS	PMC5348174.xml	S128	Discussion	POS	To analyze the effective usefulness of the categorized MV or VT in the initial setting of home ventilator, a future prospective study may be necessary.
SEMI	POS	PMC5348174.xml	S129	Discussion	POS	Second, we only included TPPV and NIPPV with facial masks, not including those with mouthpieces and nasal masks.
SEMI	POS	PMC5348174.xml	S130	Discussion	POS	We were unable to quantify the leakage volume due to the retrospective nature of this study, especially in the NIPPV group.
SEMI	POS	PMC5348174.xml	S131	Discussion	POS	Therefore, we did not include NIPPV with mouthpieces or nasal masks to minimize the variable of leakage volume.
SEMI	POS	PMC5348174.xml	S132	Discussion	POS	In NIPPV, nasal masks are not recommended in an acute setting because it tends to lead to mask failure in >72% of subjects and seems to lower CO2 to a lesser extent compared with facial masks.[22–24]
SEMI	POS	PMC5348174.xml	S133	Discussion	POS	In the case of mouthpieces, despite its comfort, there is a greater risk of hypoventilation.[25]
SEMI	POS	PMC5348174.xml	S134	Discussion	POS	Further studies that include other various types of ventilators might be helpful to better compare the effectiveness of each type.
SEMI	POS	PMC5348174.xml	S135	Discussion	POS	Lastly, we only included 5 ALS patients who underwent a change in the ventilator application from NIPPV to TPPV.
SEMI	POS	PMC5348174.xml	S136	Discussion	POS	Although 5 ALS patients showed interesting results with relatively constant PIP, even after changing the ventilator application, we were unable to generalize this finding in patients with ALS due to this limitation.
SEMI	POS	PMC5348174.xml	S137	Discussion	POS	However, the findings of this study showed that PIP may be an important parameter in ventilator settings regardless of the leakage, especially when NIPPV is applied to patients with ALS.
SEMI	POS	PMC5348174.xml	S138	Discussion	POS	In addition, it will be helpful to know the differences of setting values between TPPV and NIPPV, especially because ALS patients are usually treated with TPPV due to the initial difficulties associated with NIPPV.

SEMI	POS	PMC5348175.xml	S192		POS	The present study had several limitations.
SEMI	POS	PMC5348175.xml	S193		POS	One major limitation of this study was that it was not a randomized clinical trial, and as such, was susceptible to certain types of bias.
SEMI	POS	PMC5348175.xml	S194		POS	In addition, it was conducted at only 1 university center, the number of cases was small, and the patients were followed up for a relatively short period time.
SEMI	POS	PMC5348175.xml	S195		POS	Therefore, it may not have been adequately powered for the measurements performed.
SEMI	POS	PMC5348175.xml	S196		POS	Furthermore, because only subjects with Stanford type A AAD were included, biased effects due to the variable effects of AAD-related medication cannot be excluded, although they are not expected.
SEMI	POS	PMC5348175.xml	S197		POS	Thus, differences between groups regarding baseline cytokines levels have to be regarded as a reactivity of the variable extent of AAD, which was unknown at grouping.
SEMI	POS	PMC5348175.xml	S198		POS	Moreover, the noble gas xenon was only administered during the cooling period of CPB.
SEMI	POS	PMC5348175.xml	S199		POS	This was a short time period, so any potential advantages of xenon with respect to organ protection characteristics could have been masked during surgery or with postoperative interventions.
SEMI	POS	PMC5348175.xml	S200		POS	Finally, although 50% xenon was used to inflate pulmonary pressure to 5 cm H2O during CPB, the effective intra-alveolar concentration of xenon was not assessed.

SEMI	NEG	PMC5348177.xml	S76	Discussion and literature review	NEG	Nevertheless, there was no relevant evidence concerning these etiologies for this patient other than the above-mentioned LPI.
SEMI	NEG	PMC5348177.xml	S84	Discussion and literature review	NEG	Melamed et al[9] first reported a case of further lens inferior dislocation following a supratemporal LPI treatment that was initially caused by trauma.
SEMI	NEG	PMC5348178.xml	S7	Abstract	NEG	Fifty-two patients aged 18–70 years underwent a tympanomastoidectomy under general anesthesia were randomly allocated to receive endotracheal intubation with cylindrical (group C, n = 26) or TaperGuard ETTs (group T, n = 26).
SEMI	NEG	PMC5348178.xml	S9	Abstract	NEG	After lateral rotation of head, the cuff pressure was measured again and readjusted to 22 cmH2O.
SEMI	NEG	PMC5348178.xml	S33	Introduction	NEG	However, recently, it was reported that the cuff pressure of a TaperGaurd ETT significantly increased after a positional change from the supine to the lateral flank position, compared to that of a cylindrical ETT.[10]
SEMI	NEG	PMC5348178.xml	S48	Methods	NEG	Patients were allocated into two groups using computer-generated randomization assed by a physician who was not involved for perioperative care (Fig. 1).
SEMI	NEG	PMC5348178.xml	S55	Methods	NEG	General anesthesia was induced with propofol 2 mg/kg, and rocuronium 0.8 mg/kg.
SEMI	NEG	PMC5348178.xml	S69	Methods	NEG	A preliminary study using 15 volunteers showed that an increase of the cuff pressure of the TaperGuard ETT in the rotation of head was 9 ± 2.3 cmH2O (mean ± standard deviation).
SEMI	NEG	PMC5348178.xml	S77	Methods	NEG	Data were expressed as mean ± SD or number (%).
SEMI	NEG	PMC5348178.xml	S90	Discussion	NEG	The excessive pressure of the ETT cuff caused the airway complications including rupture of trachea during mechanical ventilation, sore throat, hoarseness, and coughing after surgery.[12–15]
SEMI	NEG	PMC5348178.xml	S101	Discussion	NEG	Therefore, it was suggested that the geometry of the ETT may be responsive for the significant difference in the intracuff pressure between TaperGuard and cylindrical ETTs because there is no difference of cuff compliance between them.[10]
SEMI	NEG	PMC5348178.xml	S103	Discussion	NEG	In the present study, the ETT was fixed with a tape on the contralateral side to operation and after lateral rotation of head toward the tube fixation side proximal migration of the ETT occurred, which is consistent with the previous study.[2]
SEMI	NEG	PMC5348178.xml	S105	Discussion	NEG	In the present study, the cephalad migration of the ETT occurred after a positional change, which may place the ETT cuff adjacent to a less compliant airway structure including cricoids cartilage.
SEMI	POS	PMC5348178.xml	S107	Discussion	POS	In this study, there are several limitations.
SEMI	POS	PMC5348178.xml	S108	Discussion	POS	First, this is a single-blinded randomized study.
SEMI	POS	PMC5348178.xml	S110	Discussion	POS	Therefore, a study unblinded anesthesiologist performed tracheal intubation and collected data during anesthesia, which can be a source of bias.
SEMI	POS	PMC5348178.xml	S111	Discussion	POS	Second, it was reported that inner diameter of the subglottis and upper trachea is less in a south Indian population than in a western population.[22]
SEMI	POS	PMC5348178.xml	S112	Discussion	POS	The present study was conducted in an only Asian population at a single center, which limited the ability to extrapolate the results beyond the selected population.
SEMI	POS	PMC5348178.xml	S113	Discussion	POS	A multicenter study is needed to verify the utility of a TaperGuard ETT in the surgeries requiring a positional change of head and neck.
SEMI	POS	PMC5348178.xml	S114	Discussion	POS	Third, in this study, there were no differences in the incidences of postoperative airway complications such as sore throat, hoarseness, and cough between two groups.
SEMI	POS	PMC5348178.xml	S115	Discussion	POS	The cuff pressure in the TaperGuard ETT significantly increased in the lateral rotation of head, compared with the cylindrical ETT.
SEMI	POS	PMC5348178.xml	S116	Discussion	POS	After a positional change, we adjusted the cuff pressure to 22 cmH2O, which can explain the reason that the incidences of postoperative airway morbidity were comparable between two groups.
SEMI	POS	PMC5348178.xml	S117	Discussion	POS	However, our findings regarding the incidence of postoperative airway complications should be considered within the context of this study because the sample size was relatively small to detect a difference in airway morbidity.
SEMI	POS	PMC5348178.xml	S118	Discussion	POS	Further studies are required to investigate the effect of the shape of the ETT cuff on airway morbidity after surgery.
SEMI	NEG	PMC5348179.xml	S37	Methods	NEG	Based on the protocol, patients aged more than 18 years old with LVEF 40% to 49%, NYHA class II–IV, and undergoing elective coronary angiography or intervention were enrolled.
SEMI	NEG	PMC5348179.xml	S54	Methods	NEG	Patients were hydrated with normal saline 2 to 12 hours preoperatively and 6 to 12 hours postoperatively.
SEMI	NEG	PMC5348179.xml	S73	Methods	NEG	A 2-tailed P < 0.05 was considered statistically significant.
SEMI	NEG	PMC5348179.xml	S81	Results	NEG	Furthermore, NT-proBNP and Mehran risk score were higher in patients with CI-AKI.
SEMI	NEG	PMC5348179.xml	S135	Discussion	NEG	It is likely that it is this position at the center of the cardiac-renal axis contributes to NT-proBNPs utility as a predictor of CI-AKI.
SEMI	NEG	PMC5348179.xml	S138	Discussion	NEG	Therefore, early identification of patients at high risk of CI-AKI and long-term mortality by NT-proBNP may assist in directing treatment and resource use where it will be of greatest benefit.
SEMI	POS	PMC5348179.xml	S141	Limitations	POS	We acknowledge several limitations of our study.
SEMI	POS	PMC5348179.xml	S142	Limitations	POS	First, this prospective observational study was conducted at a single center and included a relatively small number of patients with HFmrEF.
SEMI	POS	PMC5348179.xml	S143	Limitations	POS	Second, the NT-proBNP level was measured in the clinical laboratory, with a detection range from 5 to 35,000 pg/mL.
SEMI	POS	PMC5348179.xml	S144	Limitations	POS	NT-proBNP level can also be measured by a point-of-care testing device, with a detection range from 60 to 9000 pg/mL.
SEMI	POS	PMC5348179.xml	S145	Limitations	POS	Therefore, the conclusions cannot be extended to point-of-care testing devices.
SEMI	POS	PMC5348179.xml	S146	Limitations	POS	Third, as the NT-proBNP level was not measured during the follow-up, we were unable to identify the association between temporal change in NT-proBNP and outcomes.
SEMI	NEG	PMC5348180.xml	S8	Abstract	NEG	Toxicity, overall survival, and response are the secondary end points.
SEMI	NEG	PMC5348180.xml	S98	Materials and methods	NEG	Multivariate analysis based on the Cox model was applied in the evaluation of independent prognostic factors and was conducted on variates with P < 0.05 at univariate analysis.
SEMI	NEG	PMC5348180.xml	S116	Results	NEG	Ten of the 27 patients were free of PD at 6 months; this finding, confirmed by an independent centralized review, surpassed the objective of 37%, reported in Brandes et al[20] study (cisplatin and standard TMZ regimen).
SEMI	NEG	PMC5348180.xml	S173	Discussion	NEG	From days 2 to 6 (beginning 24 hours after the first dosage of cisplatin), TMZ (200 mg/m2) was given as an individual oral daily dosage, and the cycle was rotated every 4 weeks.
SEMI	NEG	PMC5348181.xml	S5	Abstract	NEG	Spirometry was performed by measuring forced vital capacity (FVC), the fraction of predicted FVC, forced expiratory volume in 1 second (FEV1), the percentage of predicted FEV1 in 1 second, FEV1 to FVC ratio, and the percentage of predicted FEV1/FVC.
SEMI	NEG	PMC5348181.xml	S19	Introduction	NEG	In addition, diastolic function and ventricular relaxation are directly damaged by arterial stiffness, negatively impacting heart function and complicating heart failure.[1,2]
SEMI	NEG	PMC5348181.xml	S48	Methods	NEG	The same doctor with experience assessed brachial blood pressure 3 consecutive times with a routine protocol, for each participant.
SEMI	NEG	PMC5348181.xml	S51	Methods	NEG	Plasma BNP concentration was measured using the Triage Meter system (Biosite, San Diego, CA) to detect a fluorescent signal that reflects the amount of BNP in the sample.
SEMI	NEG	PMC5348181.xml	S54	Methods	NEG	All biochemical measurements were performed at the central laboratory of Zhejiang Hospital (Hangzhou, China).
SEMI	NEG	PMC5348181.xml	S70	Methods	NEG	Right and left CAVI values were averaged.
SEMI	NEG	PMC5348181.xml	S111	Results	NEG	8.27 ± 0.14; P = 0.0008), whereas among patients with FEV1>2.38 L/s, CAVI values were similar across different age subgroups (P = 0.86) (Fig. 1).
SEMI	NEG	PMC5348181.xml	S120	Discussion	NEG	The association of pulmonary functions with arterial stiffness has been studied widely over the last few years.
SEMI	NEG	PMC5348181.xml	S129	Discussion	NEG	This study indicated for the first time that in CHF patients, CAVI was significantly correlated to FEV1 after adjusting for confounders, supporting the notion of an association of pulmonary function with arterial stiffness.
SEMI	NEG	PMC5348181.xml	S147	Discussion	NEG	Our study showed for the first time age– and smoking–pulmonary function interaction on arterial stiffness in patients with CHF.
SEMI	POS	PMC5348181.xml	S155	Discussion	POS	This study had several limitations.
SEMI	POS	PMC5348181.xml	S156	Discussion	POS	First, no distinction was made between heart failure patients with preserved and reduced left ventricular EF.
SEMI	POS	PMC5348181.xml	S157	Discussion	POS	Diastolic function was assessed without tissue Doppler imaging.
SEMI	POS	PMC5348181.xml	S158	Discussion	POS	In addition, all assessed subjects were stable, and could perform pulmonary function assays; therefore, these findings might not be applicable to individuals with severe heart failure.
SEMI	POS	PMC5348181.xml	S159	Discussion	POS	Some biases could be present because of the differences in clinical parameters caused by smoking.
SEMI	POS	PMC5348181.xml	S160	Discussion	POS	Nevertheless, these differences are intrinsic to smoking and one of the aims of the present study was to examine the effect of smoking on arterial stiffness and clinical parameters in this population of patients.
SEMI	POS	PMC5348181.xml	S161	Discussion	POS	In addition, the associations revealed by the multivariate analysis were relatively weak.
SEMI	POS	PMC5348181.xml	S162	Discussion	POS	The sample size was relatively small and the clinical manifestations of the patient covered a relatively wide range, introducing variability in the study; large sample studies are warranted to confirm these findings and control for these biases.
SEMI	POS	PMC5348181.xml	S163	Discussion	POS	Finally, nonsmoker and smoker groups were quite equilibrated in size, which could impact the statistical power.
SEMI	POS	PMC5348181.xml	S164	Discussion	POS	However, the interaction between smoking, age, and CAVI is a novel finding.
SEMI	NEG	PMC5348182.xml	S34	Methods	NEG	These patients had definite PDR and persistent vitreous hemorrhage >2 weeks, and PRP was not performed because of an invisible fundus.[18]
SEMI	NEG	PMC5348182.xml	S37	Methods	NEG	We waited for resolution up to a maximum of 10 weeks.[21–23]
SEMI	NEG	PMC5348182.xml	S82	Discussion	NEG	The CTGF/VEGF, which was a good predictor of fibrosis, was shifted toward increased levels of CTGF that led to accelerated fibrosis.[34,35]
SEMI	NEG	PMC5348182.xml	S87	Discussion	NEG	Therefore, additional studies are needed to examine CTGF and VEGF levels.
SEMI	NEG	PMC5348183.xml	S27	Introduction	NEG	The coexistence of these 2 abnormal vasculatures in hemolymphangioma is not well understood, but it strengthens the hypothesis that both blood and lymph-endothelial cell originate from common stem cell.
SEMI	NEG	PMC5348183.xml	S101	Discussion	NEG	Blood stasis in malformed and dilated blood vessel usually shows partial or complete thrombosis and is often associated with dystrophic calcification.[2]
SEMI	NEG	PMC5348183.xml	S109	Discussion	NEG	Besides diagnosis, radiological tests such as CT and magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) can also help find the extent of the lesion and plan the appropriate treatment.
SEMI	NEG	PMC5348183.xml	S112	Discussion	NEG	In conclusion, hemolymphangioma of the rectum is a rare cause of rectal bleeding.
SEMI	NEG	PMC5348186.xml	S5	Abstract	NEG	This study aimed to investigate the possible association between sleep duration and sarcopenia in a population of Chinese community-dwelling older adults.
SEMI	NEG	PMC5348186.xml	S12	Abstract	NEG	Similar results were found in men; however, the differences between groups were not statistically significant (18.5%, 20.6%, and 13.0%, respectively; P = .356
SEMI	NEG	PMC5348186.xml	S18	Introduction	NEG	Sleep disorders, such as insomnia and poor sleep quality, are very common in older adults.
SEMI	NEG	PMC5348186.xml	S59	Methods	NEG	In this study, we estimated the muscle mass by the appendicular skeletal muscle mass (ASM) using the following equation which was previously validated in a Chinese population[9]: 
SEMI	NEG	PMC5348186.xml	S71	Methods	NEG	The participants’ usual gait speed (in m/s) was measured in a 20-meter walking test.
SEMI	NEG	PMC5348186.xml	S87	Methods	NEG	Demographic and clinical characteristics were compared according to the sleep duration category.
SEMI	NEG	PMC5348186.xml	S96	Methods	NEG	We also stratified the data by gender, because gender difference was identified in the association between sleep and sarcopenia in a previous study.[18]
SEMI	NEG	PMC5348186.xml	S104	Results	NEG	There were no significant differences between the included and excluded participants with respect to age (70.6 ± 6.6 years vs 71.2 ± 7.2 years), gender (58.6% vs 53.9%), and BMI (22.9 ± 3.2 vs 23.1 ± 2.9).
SEMI	NEG	PMC5348186.xml	S117	Results	NEG	In women, the prevalence of sarcopenia was significantly higher in the short sleep duration group (27.5%) and long sleep duration group (22.2%) compared with those in the normal sleep duration group (13.9%, P = 0.014).
SEMI	NEG	PMC5348186.xml	S143	Discussion	NEG	First, it is well known that sleep exerts a significant modulatory effect not only on metabolism, but also on hormones.[20]
SEMI	NEG	PMC5348186.xml	S150	Discussion	NEG	Oxidative stress has been proven to contribute to age-related reduction in skeletal muscle function,[27] and genetically enhancing mitochondrial antioxidant activity was found to improve skeletal muscle function in aged mice.[28]
SEMI	NEG	PMC5348186.xml	S151	Discussion	NEG	The finding that long sleep duration was associated with sarcopenia was similar with the results of Chien's study.[18]
SEMI	NEG	PMC5348186.xml	S157	Discussion	NEG	Recently, a large investigation study demonstrated that both shorter (≤6 h) and longer sleep (≥10 h) durations were related to higher risks of dyslipidemia (hypercholesterolemia and hyper-low-density lipoprotein cholesterolemia) in Chinese women but not in men.[30]
SEMI	NEG	PMC5348186.xml	S162	Discussion	NEG	The validated interventions for sarcopenia are limited to lifestyle interventions, such as nutrition therapy and physical activities.[32]
SEMI	NEG	PMC5348186.xml	S167	Discussion	NEG	Although a similar trend was identified in the older men, the results were not statistically significant.
SEMI	NEG	PMC5348186.xml	S168	Discussion	NEG	The possible reason for the gender difference in the association of sleep duration and sarcopenia was the smaller sample size in men than in women (251 vs 356).
SEMI	POS	PMC5348186.xml	S170	Discussion	POS	This study has some limitations.
SEMI	POS	PMC5348186.xml	S171	Discussion	POS	First, sleep duration information was obtained from retrospective self-reporting instead of actigraphy; therefore, a recall bias might be induced.
SEMI	POS	PMC5348186.xml	S172	Discussion	POS	Difference between self-reported and actigraphy-measured sleep time has been reported; the concordance between these 2 measurements was up to 66% to 78% of old adults in a previous study.[33]
SEMI	POS	PMC5348186.xml	S173	Discussion	POS	Second, the muscle mass was estimated with a previously validated anthropometric equation, rather than the BIA or DXA as recommended by the AWGS.[8]
SEMI	POS	PMC5348186.xml	S174	Discussion	POS	Some experts argued that anthropometric measures are a poor marker of muscle mass.[34]
SEMI	POS	PMC5348186.xml	S175	Discussion	POS	However, the cut-off points of BIA for defining low muscle mass in Chinese older people have not been established yet.[35]
SEMI	POS	PMC5348186.xml	S176	Discussion	POS	DXA is expensive and not suitable for community studies.
SEMI	POS	PMC5348186.xml	S177	Discussion	POS	Furthermore, a recent study indicated that the muscle mass (estimated by anthropometric equations) combined with the handgrip and gait speed comprised an important alternative to DXA to improve the diagnosis of sarcopenia and reduced costs.[10]
SEMI	POS	PMC5348186.xml	S178	Discussion	POS	Fourth, the AWGS suggested using a 6-meter walking test to measure gait speed.[8]
SEMI	POS	PMC5348186.xml	S179	Discussion	POS	In this study, we applied a 20-meter walking test; therefore, the walking distance was longer than the AWGS recommendation.
SEMI	POS	PMC5348186.xml	S180	Discussion	POS	However, a recent systematic review with 48 studies indicated that the “distance walked during the gait speed test did not influence the recorded gait speed.”[36] Fifth, 280 participants (31.6%) were excluded due to missing data for gait speed, handgrip strength, and/or sleep duration.
SEMI	POS	PMC5348186.xml	S181	Discussion	POS	The exclusion of participants may induce a selection bias in the results.
SEMI	POS	PMC5348186.xml	S182	Discussion	POS	Sixth, although we asked the participants the time they went to sleep at night and the time they woke up to make the data of sleep duration more reliable.
SEMI	POS	PMC5348186.xml	S183	Discussion	POS	We only recorded the categories of sleep duration in our database.
SEMI	POS	PMC5348186.xml	S184	Discussion	POS	This might cause statistical information loss.
SEMI	POS	PMC5348186.xml	S185	Discussion	POS	Finally, although we adjusted the analyses for many potential confounding factors, the possibility of residual confounding cannot be eliminated.
SEMI	NEG	PMC5348187.xml	S101	Case report	NEG	Immunohistochemical analyses for the 4 cases were similar (Fig. 2C–E).
SEMI	NEG	PMC5348187.xml	S118	Discussion	NEG	Di Bona et al[21] found that AML-M5 accounted for 37% in 37 AML cases of CD56 positivity.
SEMI	NEG	PMC5348187.xml	S130	Discussion	NEG	In addition, immunohistochemistry may display features identical to those of primary cancer, and bone and blood examination may fail to show abnormalities.
SEMI	NEG	PMC5348187.xml	S139	Discussion	NEG	LTD, Taizhou City, Zhejiang province, China), neomycin daunorubicin, cytarabine, retinoic acid, gituximab, etoposide, and methotrexate are used.
SEMI	NEG	PMC5348188.xml	S5	Abstract	NEG	Among all cutaneous sites, the scalp is a rare site of representation.
SEMI	NEG	PMC5348188.xml	S36	Case report	NEG	The surface tension of the local scalp was high.
SEMI	NEG	PMC5348188.xml	S64	Discussion	NEG	Notwithstanding, the most difficult part is to decide on the sequence of treatment.[6]
SEMI	NEG	PMC5348188.xml	S72	Discussion	NEG	This case highlighted the limited access to standard treatment options in patients with advanced age.
SEMI	NEG	PMC5348189.xml	S28		NEG	In Taiwan, the mechanism of trauma injury is different from that in Western countries, with motorcycle accidents and fall injuries comprising most of the trauma injuries that require hospital admission.[13–15]
SEMI	NEG	PMC5348189.xml	S55		NEG	The fall heights (<1 meter (m), 1–6 m, and >6 m) of the patients who had sustained fall injuries were identified; however, those who fell during an attempted suicide or who had nonvalidated BMI values or incomplete data were excluded.
SEMI	NEG	PMC5348189.xml	S70		NEG	Statistically more underweight and less normal-weight patients were females.
SEMI	NEG	PMC5348189.xml	S99		NEG	The difference in helmet wearing between underweight and normal-weight motorcycle riders was not statistically significant.
SEMI	NEG	PMC5348190.xml	S53	Results	NEG	Among the acute of NEC infants, 46 infants (24.5%) required early surgical treatment after a median time period of 7 days (range: 2–19).
SEMI	NEG	PMC5348190.xml	S64	Results	NEG	No differences of clinical status of patients, such as vasopressor use at onset of NEC, respiratory support before or at the time of referral, transfusion pre-NEC strictures, and enteral feeding, etc, were found between the 2 groups, which suggested that the study population reasonably represented the spectrum of neonates with NEC in our institutions (Table 1).
SEMI	NEG	PMC5348190.xml	S82	Results	NEG	No significant differences were found in nutritional variables between the 2 groups within the in-hospital period (albumin and prealbumin).
SEMI	NEG	PMC5348190.xml	S108	Discussion	NEG	We previously found that the infants who develop NEC after 10 days of life do influence postoperative outcome survival or other clinically important outcomes (under press).
SEMI	NEG	PMC5348190.xml	S117	Discussion	NEG	There are other factors in the current study that might contribute to the likelihood of post-NEC stricture, the degree of intestinal obstruction and the severity of illness, including congenital anomalies, mechanical ventilation time, and length of hospital stay, which proved to be associated with post-NEC strictures.[2,6,27]
SEMI	POS	PMC5348190.xml	S123	Discussion	POS	Although our study is the largest reported series of post-NEC strictures, it has several limitations.
SEMI	POS	PMC5348190.xml	S124	Discussion	POS	Weaknesses of our study include the retrospective nature, in which we collected the data with an inherent risk of selection bias.
SEMI	POS	PMC5348190.xml	S125	Discussion	POS	Furthermore, the results of this study were based on an intent-to-treat analysis.
SEMI	POS	PMC5348190.xml	S126	Discussion	POS	Infants included in this study were referred from other neonatal units for surgical evaluation and could represent the severe end of NEC spectrum making the observations not applicable to perinatal settings that medically manage infants with NEC.
SEMI	POS	PMC5348190.xml	S127	Discussion	POS	There were a number of infant withdrawals of support, making it difficult to interpret the survival data.
SEMI	POS	PMC5348190.xml	S128	Discussion	POS	The study also takes place over a long time period and outcomes from many patients may not reflect outcomes from current treatment algorithms; there have likely been many practice changes within both the surgery and the neonatology divisions, leading to different care practices between study patients.
SEMI	NEG	PMC5348190.xml	S133	Conclusion	NEG	We acknowledge that these results are based on a homogenous group of patients.
SEMI	NEG	PMC5348191.xml	S22		NEG	Moreover, the effectiveness of skin cancer screening in general still remains to be determined.[6]
SEMI	NEG	PMC5348191.xml	S26		NEG	The role of total-body exams might be the one of a case-finding procedure in an at-risk population, rather than a population-based screening intervention.
SEMI	NEG	PMC5348191.xml	S34		NEG	To assess a screening intervention in this context, test performance measures (sensitivity, specificity, and predictive values) in directing malignant lesions to further evaluation (and treatment) and withholding these measures in non-malignant skin lesions are needed to know.
SEMI	NEG	PMC5348191.xml	S106		NEG	Conventional images alone were suitable to perform skin cancer screening in 182 (93.3%) of the cases, in the image package including teledermoscopic images 192 (98.5%) skin lesions were suitable.
SEMI	POS	PMC5348191.xml	S145		POS	Limitations to this study are the following: first, only 1 teledermatologist was involved and since there is no standardized training or generally accepted method of image acquisition and image evaluation, reproducibility of our results is uncertain.
SEMI	POS	PMC5348191.xml	S146		POS	The low-level of efforts needed to implement image acquisition combined with the positive results per se, however, are encouraging for further pursuit of the concept.
SEMI	POS	PMC5348191.xml	S147		POS	Secondly, teledermatology may still have missed skin cancers because histopathology was not available in every 195 skin lesion assessed, however, these hypothetical skin cancers would have also been missed by the face-to-face examinations.
SEMI	POS	PMC5348191.xml	S148		POS	Therefore, teledermatology was at least non-inferior to face-to-face examinations that are themselves the commonly accepted standard in skin cancer screening.
SEMI	NEG	PMC5348192.xml	S5	Abstract	NEG	All patients had risk factors for development of placenta accreta: previous cesarean sections (4/21), previous curettage (15/21), or uterine malformations (7/21).
SEMI	NEG	PMC5348192.xml	S33	Materials and methods	NEG	The study evaluated the 21 patients who had developed placenta accreta and suffered with concomitant fever for various clinical characteristics and management strategies, between January 2012 and August 2014.
SEMI	NEG	PMC5348192.xml	S71	Results	NEG	Their WBC levels had decreased after placental separation.
SEMI	NEG	PMC5348192.xml	S84	Results	NEG	Manual placenta removal was attempted in all patients but had failed in 20/21 patients (95.24%).
SEMI	NEG	PMC5348193.xml	S23	INTRODUCTION	NEG	However, although differences in the rates of PCa exist between men in urban and rural areas in China, the overall incidence of PCa is increasing, and become most common type of cancer among urban Chinese men,[3,4] which highlights the need for improved screening methods for PCa to reduce cancer-related mortality in China.
SEMI	NEG	PMC5348193.xml	S116	RESULTS	NEG	Adjustment for age did not alter these associations substantially.
SEMI	NEG	PMC5348193.xml	S120	RESULTS	NEG	These findings suggest that the TT genotype is a risk factor for PCa and that the TC genotype may diminish PCa tumorigenesis, based on the inclusion of the Gleason score and tumor stage in the risk category assignment and the low frequency of the TC genotype in high- and moderate-risk PCa patients.
SEMI	NEG	PMC5348193.xml	S132	DISCUSSION	NEG	Therefore, our findings might not be representative of men in all regions of China.
SEMI	NEG	PMC5348194.xml	S33	Materials and methods	NEG	The coverage rate has approached more than 99% of Taiwan's 22.9 million residents since 1997.[7,8] The National Health Insurance Research Database (NHIRD) is supervised by the National Health Research Institute, Taiwan, and scientists are authorized to use it for research and medical purposes in Taiwan.
SEMI	NEG	PMC5348194.xml	S38	Materials and methods	NEG	Approval from the institutional review board of China Medical University Hospital was obtained with the number of CMUH104-REC2-115.
SEMI	NEG	PMC5348194.xml	S150	Discussion	NEG	Acute hemorrhoid discomfort was aggravated in pregnant women with pre-existing hemorrhoids,[25] but we did not collect this information.
SEMI	NEG	PMC5348194.xml	S151	Discussion	NEG	No doubt, smoking is a strong risk factor of COPD, but the relevant information could not be provided due to the nature of the NHI database.
SEMI	NEG	PMC5348195.xml	S89	Ethics statement	NEG	The strength of the statistical association was measured by adjusted OR and 95% confidence intervals.
SEMI	NEG	PMC5348195.xml	S122	Results	NEG	Finally, with the lowest proportion (1.7%) subtypes C and G.
SEMI	NEG	PMC5348195.xml	S204	Discussion	NEG	Indeed, the level of adherence in antiretroviral drug-treated children was associated inversely with plasma HIV-1 RNA at 6 months of antiretroviral treatment.[21]
SEMI	NEG	PMC5348195.xml	S280	Discussion	NEG	Furthermore, those failing a PI regimen, but with NRTI resistance (such as TAMs) are unlikely to achieve full virological suppression on a second-line NNRTI regimen, and thus rapidly acquire NNRTI resistance.
SEMI	NEG	PMC5348196.xml	S8	Abstract	NEG	Results showed that bank workers were aware of the nutritive value of foods, and that eating practices commonly adopted included skipping breakfast, eating breakfast at work, buying food at work from the bank canteen, eating in between meals, buying snacks as lunch, and consuming soft drinks daily, among others.
SEMI	NEG	PMC5348196.xml	S16	Introduction	NEG	Adequate and proper nutrition is an important aspect of a healthy lifestyle.[1,2]
SEMI	NEG	PMC5348196.xml	S22	Introduction	NEG	The World Health Organization (WHO) reported that nutrition-related diseases account for about 60% of all deaths, and 43% of the global burden of disease,[6] and that by 2020, the impact of nutrition-related noncommunicable diseases is expected to rise to 73% of all deaths and 60% of the global burden of disease.[7]
SEMI	NEG	PMC5348196.xml	S25	Introduction	NEG	Thus, given the roles played by nutrients in promoting health and optimal functioning in humans, counseling and education about diet and nutrition need to be made a priority by all relevant professionals, including nutritional counselors, home economists, and dieticians.
SEMI	NEG	PMC5348196.xml	S75	Methods	NEG	The Eating Practices of Bank Workers and Nutrition Awareness Questionnaire (EPBWNAQ) is a 27-item questionnaire developed by the researchers, which consists of 2 sections—A and B.
SEMI	NEG	PMC5348196.xml	S77	Methods	NEG	Items in the first cluster of section B are answered on a 4-point scale (Extremely Aware [EA] = 4, Moderately Aware MA] = 3, Slightly Aware [SA] = 2, and Not Aware [NA] = 1).
SEMI	NEG	PMC5348196.xml	S94	Methods	NEG	Using purposively set benchmark mean values, the item scores of the first cluster of the EPBWNAQ section B (awareness of food nutritive value) were interpreted as follows: Extremely Aware (EA) = 3.50–4.00; Moderately Aware (MA) = 3.00–3.49; Slightly Aware (SA) = 2.50–2.99; and Not Aware (NA) = 1.00–2.49.
SEMI	NEG	PMC5348196.xml	S145	Discussion	NEG	Nutritional counseling and education intervention programs could take the form of nutrition seminars, workshops, and nutritional counseling symposia.
SEMI	POS	PMC5348196.xml	S149	Limitations	POS	The present study has some limitations.
SEMI	POS	PMC5348196.xml	S150	Limitations	POS	First, considering only one variable (sex) can limit the contribution made by the study.
SEMI	POS	PMC5348196.xml	S151	Limitations	POS	Demographic characteristics such as educational background, ethnicity, marital status, and religious orientation were not included, and this might affect the generalizability of the results.
SEMI	POS	PMC5348196.xml	S152	Limitations	POS	Further limitations involve the lack of data on variables such as age, years working in the bank, and ranking, which could have provided a broader platform to describe the eating practices and awareness of food nutritive value of bank workers.
SEMI	POS	PMC5348196.xml	S153	Limitations	POS	Future studies are urged to assess these sociodemographic characteristics of bank staff to more significantly describe the eating behaviors and awareness of food nutritive value of this occupational group both in Nigeria and in other countries.
SEMI	POS	PMC5348196.xml	S154	Limitations	POS	Additionally, the study sample size was small, and thus, the current findings are not fully generalizable to the entire population of bank staff in Nigeria.
SEMI	POS	PMC5348196.xml	S155	Limitations	POS	The researchers hope that future studies will include larger samples and also cover a wider study area, and that similar studies on this population will be conducted in other countries.
SEMI	POS	PMC5348196.xml	S156	Limitations	POS	Finally, some nutrition experts might argue that the item statements of the questionnaire stating that carbohydrates raise blood sugar and glucose stimulates the production of insulin would be relevant only if this study focused on people with diabetes.
SEMI	POS	PMC5348196.xml	S157	Limitations	POS	However, the inclusion of these statements aimed to unveil the respondents’ general understanding of food nutritive value in the Nigerian context.
SEMI	POS	PMC5348196.xml	S158	Limitations	POS	It is possible that an individual is aware of this information even though s/he is not a diabetic, and s/he could use such information in handling future health concerns related to diabetes in his/her household.
SEMI	POS	PMC5348196.xml	S159	Limitations	POS	Therefore, exploring such knowledge is critical for future studies focusing on the awareness of eating practices and food nutritive value, especially in developing countries such as Nigeria.
SEMI	NEG	PMC5348196.xml	S162	Implications	NEG	Poor eating behaviors and nutrition knowledge deficits may harmfully affect health and increase healthcare costs.
SEMI	NEG	PMC5348196.xml	S174	Conclusions	NEG	Good eating habits will help bank workers not only to improve their nutritional well-being, but also to prevent nutrition-related diseases.
SEMI	NEG	PMC5348196.xml	S175	Conclusions	NEG	Various media should be used for the dissemination of nutritional information among bank workers.
SEMI	NEG	PMC5348197.xml	S38	Materials and methods	NEG	Patients who met the following criteria were recruited: had PTC once, had already accepted thyroid surgery, were confirmed as lymph node recurrence by fine-needle aspiration biopsy (FNAB), all the suspicious lymph nodes were nonpalpable, and agreed to accept reoperation.
SEMI	NEG	PMC5348197.xml	S49	Materials and methods	NEG	A volume of 0.05 to 0.1 mL of dyeing materials was injected into suspicious lesions based on the size of lesions.
SEMI	NEG	PMC5348197.xml	S91	Results	NEG	All the lesions were injected with CNs, and 99 of 102 lesions were successfully identified by surgeon in the reoperation.
SEMI	NEG	PMC5348197.xml	S119	Results	NEG	Moreover, so far, our follow-up showed that there was no recurrence in the 2 groups.
SEMI	NEG	PMC5348197.xml	S169	Discussion and conclusion	NEG	All 3 failed injected lesions occurred in the early stage of our study, when radiologists in our hospital had not been familiar with this procedure yet.
SEMI	POS	PMC5348197.xml	S170	Discussion and conclusion	POS	Our study had some limitations.
SEMI	POS	PMC5348197.xml	S171	Discussion and conclusion	POS	First of all, our study was not a prospective randomized control one.
SEMI	POS	PMC5348197.xml	S172	Discussion and conclusion	POS	Second, the number of patients in our study was small.
SEMI	POS	PMC5348197.xml	S173	Discussion and conclusion	POS	Third, our follow-up period was just 6 months, which is inadequate for the observation of recurrence.
SEMI	POS	PMC5348197.xml	S174	Discussion and conclusion	POS	More large randomized control prospective studies are warranted in the future.
SEMI	NEG	PMC5348198.xml	S24	Introduction	NEG	Among the various methods of controlling postoperative pain, intravenous patient-controlled analgesia (IV-PCA) has been used extensively, based on its improved pain control and minimal side effects.[3]
SEMI	NEG	PMC5348198.xml	S33	Introduction	NEG	The fentanyl–oxycodone dose conversion ratio was estimated indirectly as 1:100, whereas studies performed based on the estimated ratio showed that the appropriate dose conversion ratio was 1:75.[9,10]]
SEMI	NEG	PMC5348198.xml	S77	Materials and methods	NEG	Measurement data are expressed as the mean and standard deviation.
SEMI	NEG	PMC5348198.xml	S79	Materials and methods	NEG	The generalized estimating equation method was used to compare IV-PCA quantity and pain level between the 2 groups postoperatively for 48 hours, both at rest and during coughing.
SEMI	NEG	PMC5348198.xml	S89	Results	NEG	The 2 groups did not significantly differ with respect to infused PCA dose at 30 minutes or 4, 8, 24, or 48 hours postoperatively; however, the amount of PCA during the first 48 hours after surgery was significantly less in group O than in group F (Fig. 1).
SEMI	NEG	PMC5348198.xml	S94	Results	NEG	In contrast, the administration of additional antiemetic drugs was significantly more frequent in group F at 8 h postoperatively (Table 3) whereas, overall, dizziness and drowsiness occurred significantly more often in group O (Table 4).
SEMI	NEG	PMC5348198.xml	S101	Discussion	NEG	The establishment of an appropriate IV-PCA dose is important for the postoperative management also of patients undergoing minor surgery.
SEMI	NEG	PMC5348198.xml	S103	Discussion	NEG	Fentanyl is commonly used in IV-PCA in our hospital, whereas oxycodone is a newly released intravenous analgesic with a shorter history of use in IV-PCA.
SEMI	POS	PMC5348198.xml	S136	Discussion	POS	The present study also had several limitations.
SEMI	POS	PMC5348198.xml	S137	Discussion	POS	First, the continuous infusion rate, lockout interval, and bolus dose could not be controlled because an Anapa PCA pump was used during IV-PCA to investigate the analgesic quantity during the first 48 postoperative hours, which was the primary outcome.
SEMI	POS	PMC5348198.xml	S138	Discussion	POS	Hence, the continuous infusion rate was not reduced even in patients with a sufficiently low NRS or in whom side effects, such as nausea, were reported.
SEMI	POS	PMC5348198.xml	S139	Discussion	POS	This resulted in an unnecessarily high incidence of PONV.
SEMI	POS	PMC5348198.xml	S140	Discussion	POS	In patients with severe side effects, the IV-PCA was closed and subsequently reopened only if the side effect had abated or if the patient requested the IV-PCA again.
SEMI	POS	PMC5348198.xml	S141	Discussion	POS	Therefore, the equianalgesic dose between fentanyl and oxycodone could not be accurately calculated.
SEMI	POS	PMC5348198.xml	S142	Discussion	POS	Second, patient age is an important factor in the use of oxycodone, with patients older than 70 years having an average oxycodone exposure 40% to 80% higher than that of young adult patients.[17]
SEMI	POS	PMC5348198.xml	S143	Discussion	POS	Because our study included only patients who were 65 years or younger, a further study of patients older than 70 years of age is required.
SEMI	NEG	PMC5348199.xml	S8	Abstract	NEG	A convenience sample of 60 points (20 active MTrPs, 20 latent MTrPs, and 20 control points) was registered bilaterally in the lumbar erector spinae muscles from subjects with nonspecific LPP.
SEMI	NEG	PMC5348199.xml	S24	Introduction	NEG	Furthermore, the lumbopelvic pain (LPP) is established as one of the 5 main causes of disability and one of the most prevalent musculoskeletal disorders.[3,4]
SEMI	NEG	PMC5348199.xml	S37	Introduction	NEG	Therefore, the main aim of this study was to determine the tensiomyography differences between the palpation area of active and latent MTrPs with regards to control points in the lumbar erector spinae muscles of subjects with LPP.
SEMI	NEG	PMC5348199.xml	S73	Methods	NEG	A good to excellent interrater reliability was described for the contractile parameters.[25]
SEMI	NEG	PMC5348199.xml	S81	Methods	NEG	The same physical therapist with 4 years of specialization and experience performed the evaluation and analyses.
SEMI	NEG	PMC5348199.xml	S82	Methods	NEG	A high quality diagnostic ultrasound system (LOGIQ P9; General Electric GE Healthcare, 510332; PRIM; Móstoles, Madrid 28938, Spain) with a high frequency from 6- to 15.0-MHz-range linear transducer (Matrix linear probe, ML6-15RS type, 510330; 50-mm footprint) was used to perform resting B-mode sonoelastography at the end of the relax expiration.
SEMI	NEG	PMC5348199.xml	S88	Methods	NEG	The mean of 3 valid repeated measures (the highest index in the green color region of the horizontal axis, at 2–4, 4–6, and 6–8 s) was used for the analyses data (Fig. 4).
SEMI	NEG	PMC5348199.xml	S110	Results	NEG	Nevertheless, PPT and sonoelastography showed statistically significant differences (P < 0.05) between all point types, except for active and latent MTrPs PPT comparison (P = 0.091), according to the Bonferroni correction (Table 2; Figs. 6 and 7).
SEMI	POS	PMC5348199.xml	S137	Discussion	POS	Several limitations should be considered in the present study.
SEMI	POS	PMC5348199.xml	S138	Discussion	POS	First, a good to excellent interrater reliability was shown for all tensiomyography contractile parameters, except for Tr which has presented insufficient reliability in prior studies.[25]
SEMI	POS	PMC5348199.xml	S139	Discussion	POS	The Dm parameter varies from one subject to another and depends on each muscle group, according to the morphofunctional and training characteristics.[34]
SEMI	POS	PMC5348199.xml	S140	Discussion	POS	Nevertheless, this bias was controlled using a bilateral evaluation and rigorous inclusion criteria.
SEMI	POS	PMC5348199.xml	S141	Discussion	POS	Furthermore, the incremental protocol and the specific sites recommended by the manufacturer were not used in order to avoid different stimulation between all point types and permit us to evaluate each specific point.
SEMI	POS	PMC5348199.xml	S142	Discussion	POS	Due to this, an electrical current intensity of 100 mA during 1 millisecond for each point was performed in order to avoid posttetanic activation.[25]
SEMI	POS	PMC5348199.xml	S143	Discussion	POS	Second, the sonoelastography manual strain index may be less reliable than other methods, such as vibration sonoelastography[13] or manual strain ratio.[27]
SEMI	POS	PMC5348199.xml	S144	Discussion	POS	Third, the statistically analysis was carried out without considering each erector spinae muscle side, although the results may not be influenced due to all points were presented in each side, according to the inclusion criteria.
SEMI	NEG	PMC5348200.xml	S62	Methods	NEG	The factorial analysis of variance was used for age and weight.
SEMI	NEG	PMC5348200.xml	S77	Discussion	NEG	Propofol formulated in a lipid emulsion is widely used in various clinical procedures.
SEMI	NEG	PMC5348200.xml	S95	Discussion	NEG	In the present study, pretreatment with esmolol 0.5 mg/kg and 1 mg/kg and remifentanil 0.35 μg/kg equally decreased pain during propofol injection.
SEMI	NEG	PMC5348200.xml	S98	Discussion	NEG	Pretreatment substances such as remifentanil and esmolol can cause dose-dependent decrease in blood pressure and heart rate.
SEMI	NEG	PMC5348200.xml	S100	Discussion	NEG	In the present study, there were no emergence reactions associated with pretreatment with remifentanil 0.35 μg/kg, and esmolol 0.5 mg/kg and 1 mg/kg.
SEMI	POS	PMC5348200.xml	S102	Discussion	POS	The present study had some limitations.
SEMI	POS	PMC5348200.xml	S103	Discussion	POS	In the present study, premedication, such as sedatives, was not given.
SEMI	POS	PMC5348200.xml	S104	Discussion	POS	This might increase the patient's anxiety and dissatisfaction about anesthetic care.[27]
SEMI	POS	PMC5348200.xml	S105	Discussion	POS	The previous study showed that 87% of patients who did not receive anxiolytic premedication reported the recall about injection pain after propofol injection.[28]
SEMI	POS	PMC5348200.xml	S106	Discussion	POS	Therefore, another study is needed to examine the patient's satisfaction about anesthetic care and the incidence of recall for pain during propofol injection.
SEMI	NEG	PMC5348201.xml	S44	Methods	NEG	Both the intra- and interassay coefficients of CysC were less than 10%.
SEMI	NEG	PMC5348201.xml	S45	Methods	NEG	CysC levels were between 0.33 and 1.81 mg/L.
SEMI	NEG	PMC5348201.xml	S46	Methods	NEG	Estimated glomerular filtration rate (Chronic Kidney Disease Epidemiology Collaboration) (eGFRCKD-EPI) equation[24] was used.
SEMI	NEG	PMC5348201.xml	S62	Methods	NEG	The non-MetS group was defined as those subjects without MetS (2 or less MetS criteria).
SEMI	NEG	PMC5348203.xml	S26	Introduction	NEG	Therefore, we speculated that central visual acuity is more resistant to elevated IOP compared with peripheral visual field in patients with POAG.
SEMI	NEG	PMC5348203.xml	S58	Methods	NEG	During the scans, we asked each participant to stare at an internal fixation point.
SEMI	NEG	PMC5348203.xml	S63	Methods	NEG	Therefore, 10 parts from the fovea signified 10° to the fovea and 24 signified 24° to the fovea.
SEMI	NEG	PMC5348203.xml	S72	Methods	NEG	We undertook the measurement by using the software Image J (version 1.42, National Institutes of Health, Bethesda, MD).[24]
SEMI	NEG	PMC5348203.xml	S109	Results	NEG	In the early-stage POAG group, the mean choroidal area of the superior-temporal, superior, and nasal sectors was significantly thicker than that of the inferior-temporal and inferior sectors.
SEMI	POS	PMC5348203.xml	S149	Discussion	POS	Several limitations of this research should be considered.
SEMI	POS	PMC5348203.xml	S150	Discussion	POS	First, our recruited sample size was relatively small, which may have affected our result.
SEMI	POS	PMC5348203.xml	S151	Discussion	POS	We hope to expand the sample size to do further research.
SEMI	POS	PMC5348203.xml	S152	Discussion	POS	Second, although through EDI-OCT we can measure the choroidal area, the choroidal area may sometimes not comprehensively represent the actual choroidal microcirculation, so we are expecting to use new methods and techniques, like OCT angiography, to monitor the choroidal microcirculation in vivo.
SEMI	POS	PMC5348203.xml	S153	Discussion	POS	Third, the use of antiglaucoma drugs may, to some degree, affect the choroidal area.
SEMI	NEG	PMC5348204.xml	S12	Abstract	NEG	The central endplate was approximately 60% of the area of the whole endplate and the anterior section of the ring was the widest.
SEMI	NEG	PMC5348204.xml	S81	Materials and methods	NEG	The projective point of the concavity apex in the mid-sagittal plane in line AB determined the relative location of the sagittal concavity apex (SCL), represented as the length of point A and the projective point divided by the length of AB.
SEMI	NEG	PMC5348204.xml	S155	Discussion	NEG	In other words, the endplate of the cervical vertebrae of Chinese cadavers is observed to be transversely elongated.
SEMI	NEG	PMC5348204.xml	S158	Discussion	NEG	The reason may be that the measuring instrument was unable to precisely evaluate the surface area at that time (Caucasians were assessed in 1991).
SEMI	NEG	PMC5348205.xml	S7	Abstract	NEG	Self-measured fever showed an odds ratio (OR) of 5.936 (CI95% 1.450–24.295; P = 0.0133) and increased pulse pressure (PP) showed an OR of 1.405 (CI95% 1.004–1.964; P = 0.0471) on multivariate analysis.
SEMI	NEG	PMC5348205.xml	S11	Abstract	NEG	The recognition of self-measured fever, increased PP, and the intensity of heart rate response may improve sepsis recognition in afebrile patients with tachycardia or tachypnea.
SEMI	NEG	PMC5348205.xml	S18	Introduction	NEG	In Brazil, mortality rates from septic shock remains particularly high, ranging between 52% and 65%.[3,4]
SEMI	NEG	PMC5348205.xml	S19	Introduction	NEG	Prompt sepsis recognition is crucial to adequate treatment[5–9] and to improve outcomes.[5–11]
SEMI	NEG	PMC5348205.xml	S25	Introduction	NEG	They also emphasize the importance of relying on clinical signs and symptoms for the early recognition of disease severity, by means of employing the quickSOFA (quick sepsis-related organ failure assessment) a score that comprises altered sensorium, heart rate, and respiratory rate.[16]
SEMI	NEG	PMC5348205.xml	S51	Material and method	NEG	The institutional ethics committee (Faculty of Medical Science) approved the study (number: 45403/date: 06/07/2012), and informed written consent was given to eligible patients or their legal representatives.
SEMI	NEG	PMC5348205.xml	S71	Material and method	NEG	Aiming to analyze factors related to sepsis, patient data input were according to the following categories: (1) gender, (2) age, (3) self-reported fever, (4) self-measured fever, (5) self-reported chills, (6) altered mental status, (7) difficulty in maintaining orthostatic position, (8) pulse pressure (PP)—the difference between systolic and diastolic pressures, (9) mean arterial pressure (MAP), (10) HR, (11) RR, (12) axillary temperature, (13) leukocyte count, (14) suspected source of infection, (15) length of hospital stay and (16) mortality, and thus collected and compared between the 2 groups: septic versus non-septic patients.
SEMI	NEG	PMC5348205.xml	S76	Material and method	NEG	No patient or family refused to participate.
SEMI	NEG	PMC5348205.xml	S146	Discussion	NEG	In summary, our findings may contribute to improvement of early sepsis recognition, and consequently, early implementation of adequate treatment.

SEMI	NEG	PMC5353891.xml	S146	Discussion	NEG	CD14 represents an important mediator of lung function, as we have shown previously that CD14 haplotypes (CD14/-1720G or CD14/-260A) are associated with decreased lung function among those exposed to agricultural environments [34].
SEMI	NEG	PMC5355363.xml	S34		NEG	CD4+ T cells that were primed in HFD donors also trafficked preferentially to the non-lymphoid, inflamed sites (peritoneal cavity) of both HFD and CD recipients (Figure 1B).
SEMI	NEG	PMC5355363.xml	S143		NEG	As we did not observe major differences in the size of the central memory population upon priming following HFD or CD, it is possible that central memory cells are functionally impaired in obesity.

SEMI	NEG	PMC5357473.xml	S59	Methods	NEG	An interim evaluation was conducted when 21–23 patients became evaluable for the 2-month tumor assessment.
SEMI	NEG	PMC5357473.xml	S91	Results	NEG	The Spearman correlation coefficient between body weight and lenvatinib Ctrough at C1D15 was −0.64.
SEMI	NEG	PMC5357473.xml	S118	Discussion	NEG	The influence of body weight on the pharmacodynamics of antiangiogenic agents and resultant toxicity patterns is still uncertain [26].
SEMI	NEG	PMC5357479.xml	S69	Methods	NEG	For part 2, the primary end points were the SVR12 rate, defined as the proportion of patients with undetectable HCV RNA (target not detected) at 12 weeks after completion of all study treatment, and the safety and tolerability of EBR at a dose of 50 mg in combination with GZR at the selected dose.
SEMI	NEG	PMC5357479.xml	S158	Results	NEG	Four relapse patients had baseline NS5A RAVs (Y93H, n = 3; L31 M, n = 1); three of these four patients acquired treatment-emergent RAVs and had both L31M and Y93H at the time of virologic failure.
SEMI	NEG	PMC5357479.xml	S165	Results	NEG	The median EBR T max was also similar between cirrhotic and noncirrhotic patients.
SEMI	NEG	PMC5357479.xml	S201	Discussion	NEG	This study demonstrated that the once daily oral combination regimen of 50 mg EBR and 100 mg GZR, given for 12 weeks, is highly efficacious and well tolerated in cirrhotic and noncirrhotic Japanese patients with chronic HCV infection.
SEMI	NEG	PMC5357489.xml	S32		NEG	In this nonsignaling state, cytosolic β-catenin is continuously phosphorylated at Ser33, Ser37, Thr41, and Ser45 residues located in exon 3 by a multiprotein complex consisting of adenomatous polyposis coli (APC), axin, glycogen synthase kinase 3β (GSK3β), and casein kinase 1.
SEMI	NEG	PMC5357489.xml	S36		NEG	This results in rescue of β-catenin from proteasomal degradation and thus the accumulation of β-catenin in the cytoplasm, eventually causing β-catenin translocation to the nucleus [20].
SEMI	NEG	PMC5357489.xml	S43		NEG	One of these stimuli is β-catenin tyrosine phosphorylation by receptor tyrosine kinases activated by growth factors produced by epithelial and stromal cells.
SEMI	NEG	PMC5357489.xml	S73		NEG	Recently, a genotype–phenotype correlation was shown for CTNNB1 mutations, suggesting that activating mutations occurring at the Asp32 to Ser37 residues lead to higher signaling levels than mutations at Thr41 and Ser45 [39].
SEMI	NEG	PMC5357975.xml	S7	Summary	NEG	We did this randomised controlled trial in 18 SSSs in England.
SEMI	NEG	PMC5357975.xml	S39	Introduction	NEG	In planning this trial, we identified studies suggesting that the direct marketing approach has potential as a population-based strategy for recruitment of smokers into support services, and that interpersonal strategies have a positive effect on recruitment into smoking cessation programmes.
SEMI	NEG	PMC5357975.xml	S67	Methods	NEG	The NIHR England Primary Care Research Network recruited SSSs and practices.
SEMI	NEG	PMC5357975.xml	S171	Results	NEG	The proportion of people completing the 6 week SSS course was likewise significantly higher in the intervention group than in the control group (14% vs 7%; unadjusted OR 2·24 [95% CI 1·81–2·78], p<0·0001; table 2).
SEMI	NEG	PMC5357975.xml	S190	Results	NEG	The mean total intervention cost was £777 (SD £2176) in the intervention group and £679 (£1860) in the control group.
SEMI	POS	PMC5357975.xml	S220	Discussion	POS	Our study has some limitations.
SEMI	POS	PMC5357975.xml	S221	Discussion	POS	Although we achieved a good geographical spread, we included only 18 of the 151 SSSs in England, and these participating SSSs might not necessarily be representative of all SSSs in England.
SEMI	POS	PMC5357975.xml	S222	Discussion	POS	A further limitation is that, despite our proactive recruitment strategy, the recruitment rate of 4·1% of potentially eligible smokers who were sent an invitation was low and, as a result, we recruited only a small proportion of smokers in each area.
SEMI	POS	PMC5357975.xml	S223	Discussion	POS	However, the sample was representative of smokers in terms of sex and deprivation, but we did not manage to recruit a sufficient number of younger smokers.
SEMI	POS	PMC5357975.xml	S224	Discussion	POS	Attendance at the SSS tends to be concentrated in older age groups, and it is important to attract younger smokers.
SEMI	NEG	PMC5359024.xml	S3	Purpose	NEG	To test the utility of magnetization transfer imaging (MTI) in detection and monitoring the progression of renal fibrosis in mice with unilateral renal artery stenosis (RAS).
SEMI	NEG	PMC5363047.xml	S13	Background	NEG	In vitro, BM-MSCs exposed to CS extract showed a significant reduction of proliferative, cellular differentiation and migratory potential and an increase in cellular senescence in a dose dependent manner.
SEMI	NEG	PMC5363047.xml	S23	Background	NEG	One additional extrapulmonary effect of COPD is bone marrow dysfunction [1].
SEMI	NEG	PMC5363047.xml	S63	Methods	NEG	3 days later, medium was replaced with Lonza Adipogenic differentiation medium, following the manufacturer’s instructions (rMSC Differentiation BulletKit®, Lonza).
SEMI	NEG	PMC5363047.xml	S135	Results	NEG	Levels of CXCL10, CXCL12 and CXCR4 were unchanged (Fig. 7).
SEMI	POS	PMC5363047.xml	S193	Discussion	POS	In this study, it can not be confirmed that reduced proliferation rate seen in vitro at 4–12 days of culture, underpins the lower recruitment potential observed after 24 h of BM-MSCs administration in vivo.
SEMI	POS	PMC5363047.xml	S194	Discussion	POS	Thus, whilst reduced migration clearly plays a role, long term cellular viability and proliferation experiments are required to conclude.
SEMI	POS	PMC5363047.xml	S195	Discussion	POS	Additionally, changes on the expression of endothelial adhesion markers following CS exposure might be at least partly accountable for the impaired BM-MSCs recruitment potential.
SEMI	POS	PMC5363047.xml	S196	Discussion	POS	Unfortunately, those markers could not be measured due to the lack availability of guinea pig-specific antibodies for adhesion markers.
SEMI	NEG	PMC5363056.xml	S20	Background	NEG	In addition to well-known anti-inflammatory features, glucocorticoids may have adverse effects on long-term remodeling by TGF-β1-independent induction of CTGF in lung cells.
SEMI	NEG	PMC5363056.xml	S121	Results	NEG	This effect was antagonized by the addition of anti-TNF-α antibody (p = 0.0001; Fig. 5a).
SEMI	NEG	PMC5363056.xml	S146	Discussion	NEG	It has been suggested that inhibition of CTGF can prevent and reverse the process of fibrosis [26].
SEMI	NEG	PMC5363056.xml	S178	Discussion	NEG	Moreover, caffeine-induced suppression of CTGF expression was only observed at high in vitro concentrations of caffeine, possibly not reflecting physiologic conditions.
SEMI	NEG	PMC5364327.xml	S29	Introduction	NEG	In light of these compelling findings, WHO recommends5 widespread implementation of voluntary medical male circumcision for HIV prevention in countries with generalised HIV epidemics and a low prevalence of male circumcision.
SEMI	NEG	PMC5364327.xml	S41	Introduction	NEG	The concept of health behaviour promotion in religious communities has been most broadly explored in church congregations in the USA.
SEMI	NEG	PMC5364327.xml	S87	Methods	NEG	Paired villages were therefore matched by geographical proximity and by the start date of the male circumcision in the village, which were prespecified to be the two most important factors for matching.
SEMI	NEG	PMC5364327.xml	S200	Discussion	NEG	Ultimately, the dissenting leader was invited to observe the operations of the male circumcision campaign at the health centre, including witnessing the burning of foreskins on site.
SEMI	NEG	PMC5364328.xml	S22	Summary	NEG	The evidence from all 117 clusters showed that no cases of Ebola virus disease occurred 10 days or more after randomisation among all immediately vaccinated contacts and contacts of contacts versus 23 cases (11 clusters affected) among all eligible contacts and contacts of contacts in delayed plus all eligible contacts and contacts of contacts never vaccinated in immediate clusters.
SEMI	NEG	PMC5364328.xml	S39	Introduction	NEG	We therefore undertook Ebola ça Suffit!
SEMI	NEG	PMC5364328.xml	S156	Results	NEG	In the randomised part of the trial, there were 4539 contacts and contacts of contacts in 51 clusters in the immediate vaccination arm (of whom 3232 were eligible, 2151 consented, and 2119 were immediately vaccinated) and 4557 contacts and contacts of contacts in 47 clusters in the delayed vaccination arm (of whom 3096 were eligible, 2539 consented and 2041 were vaccinated 21 days after randomisation; figure 1).
SEMI	NEG	PMC5364328.xml	S208	Discussion	NEG	The current report included data from 27 additional clusters; eight of which were randomly assigned to immediate or delayed vaccination.
SEMI	NEG	PMC5364604.xml	S14	Background	NEG	Non-canonical rhWnt5a induced down-regulation of both ABCB1 and ABCG2 transporters in the primary human lung aggregate tissue model recreating the SCC-like transporter pattern.
SEMI	NEG	PMC5364604.xml	S33	Background	NEG	And although the use of immune modulators (e.g.
SEMI	NEG	PMC5364604.xml	S81	Methods	NEG	Total RNA from frozen human lung samples was isolated using TRI Reagent (Invitrogen, Thermo Fisher Scientific, Waltham, USA) with an additional DNase (Sigma-Aldrich, St Louis, USA) treatment.
SEMI	NEG	PMC5364604.xml	S183	Discussion	NEG	Despite extensive studies, the precise biochemical mechanism of cisplatin induced modification of Wnt pathway activity that leads to altered ABC transporter expression and function is still not fully understood.
SEMI	NEG	PMC5366117.xml	S7	Background	NEG	Rats were studied at 2, 4, and 6 weeks after subcutaneous injection of 60 mg/kg monocrotaline (MCT) (MCT-2 W, 4 W, 6 W) or vehicle (CON-2 W, 4 W, 6 W).
SEMI	NEG	PMC5366117.xml	S62	Methods	NEG	Echocardiography was performed according to the recommendations of the American College of Echocardiography [28].
SEMI	NEG	PMC5366117.xml	S74	Methods	NEG	Pressure waveforms were low in the SVC and slightly increased in pulsatility in the RA.
SEMI	NEG	PMC5366117.xml	S94	Methods	NEG	Two-step qRT-PCR was used to quantify relative LC3 mRNA by the ABI PRISM® 7500 qPCR System (Applied Biosystems, Foster City, CA, USA) using SYBR Green.
SEMI	NEG	PMC5366117.xml	S166	Results	NEG	Also, no significant difference in levels of these proteins could be observed in the LV of MCT-treated rats (Fig. 5c).
SEMI	NEG	PMC5366117.xml	S234	Discussion	NEG	That is, the mitochondrial perturbations triggered by BNIP3 gene activation were found to parallel opening of the mitochondrial permeability transition pore, mitochondrial membrane potential loss, and cell death [48].
SEMI	NEG	PMC5366117.xml	S240	Discussion	NEG	Beclin-1 is a downstream target of BNIP3.
SEMI	NEG	PMC5366117.xml	S242	Discussion	NEG	Conversely, cardiac-specific Beclin-1 overexpressing mice resulted in an amplified pathological remodeling response [52].
SEMI	NEG	PMC5366117.xml	S247	Discussion	NEG	To date, no medications specifically target myocardial autophagy.
SEMI	NEG	PMC5366117.xml	S249	Discussion	NEG	Our findings also support previous studies that demonstrate that treatment with rapamycin, an inhibitor of mTOR, resulted in prevention of RV hypertrophy and dysfunction in an animal model of PH [53].
SEMI	POS	PMC5366117.xml	S252	Discussion	POS	Our study has some limitations.
SEMI	POS	PMC5366117.xml	S253	Discussion	POS	Firstly, we did not investigate the effects of selectively upregulating and inhibiting autophagy by pharmaceutical agents at different stages of RV remodeling in PH.
SEMI	POS	PMC5366117.xml	S254	Discussion	POS	This was not performed in the current study owing to the present limitation in identifying pharmacological reagents that selectively target cardiac autophagy.
SEMI	POS	PMC5366117.xml	S255	Discussion	POS	Secondly, another potential limitation of our study is that the autophagy signatures in the RV of the MCT model associated with PH could be very different from other animal models of PH due to hypoxia, Sugen/ hypoxia, hyperflow, [34] and the PAB rat model [54].
SEMI	POS	PMC5366117.xml	S256	Discussion	POS	For example, the PAB model impacts RV hypertrophy but has no impact on the pulmonary vasculature—possibly one of the important causes of RV hypoxia in the MCT model that may also impact autophagy in the RV [29].
SEMI	POS	PMC5366117.xml	S257	Discussion	POS	Thus, whether our findings can apply to other models warrants further study.
SEMI	POS	PMC5366117.xml	S258	Discussion	POS	It is important to also note that it remains unclear whether the findings in the MCT model can be generalized to humans.
SEMI	POS	PMC5366117.xml	S259	Discussion	POS	Thus, future studies should also consider the assessment of autophagy signatures in RV tissues, of PH patients with different etiologies.
SEMI	POS	PMC5366117.xml	S260	Discussion	POS	Furthermore, fibrosis is an important feature of RV remodeling; however, our study does not assess a causality chain between myocardial fibrosis and these autophagic signaling pathways.
SEMI	POS	PMC5366117.xml	S261	Discussion	POS	Thus, comprehensive in vivo and in vitro studies are required to test this hypothesis in the future.
SEMI	NEG	PMC5369875.xml	S43		NEG	HCC was diagnosed based on histological findings or typical imaging characteristics as defined by the Korean Liver Cancer Study Group Guideline.[27]
SEMI	NEG	PMC5369875.xml	S125		NEG	We performed direct comparisons of the usefulness of AFP, AFP-L3, and PIVKA-II both individually and in combination in diagnosing HCC, and found that AFP was the best individual marker for differentiating between HCC and LC (sensitivity 68.35%, specificity 81.82%, AUC 0.751, 95% CI 0.683–0.818).
SEMI	POS	PMC5369875.xml	S132		POS	This study was subject to several limitations.

SEMI	NEG	PMC5369876.xml	S78	Materials and methods	NEG	The target protein was quantified by gray scanning with the help of Bandscan software (PROZYME, San Leandro, CA).
SEMI	NEG	PMC5369877.xml	S94		NEG	The ophthalmologist and optometrist enrolled the participants, and the clinical coordinator assigned the participants to the interventions.
SEMI	NEG	PMC5369877.xml	S105		NEG	After study group assignments were made and an identification numbers were issued by the coordinating center, the randomization visit was held.
SEMI	NEG	PMC5369877.xml	S240		NEG	Table 2 shows the basic data of the 211 children enrolled in the study.
SEMI	NEG	PMC5369877.xml	S299		NEG	This difference maybe because COMET2 only enrolled children with a high lag of accommodation and also implies that our subjects had a high accommodative lag.
SEMI	NEG	PMC5369878.xml	S20	Abstract	NEG	The patient did not have fever and the infection healed.
SEMI	NEG	PMC5369878.xml	S48	Case report	NEG	The patient underwent the second operation to repair the torn dura mater and debride the cyst on the 19th postoperative day.
SEMI	NEG	PMC5369878.xml	S67	Case report	NEG	Further, an epidural drain was placed, and the paraspinal muscles and fascia were closed in 2 layers, in a figure-of-eight fashion, to create a watertight closure.

SEMI	NEG	PMC5369881.xml	S19	Introduction	NEG	To remedy this, %fPSA was applied clinically and significantly enhanced the detection rate of PCa in patients with tPSA levels of 4 to 10 ng/mL.[5,6]
SEMI	NEG	PMC5369881.xml	S42	Materials and methods	NEG	Attending urologists performed ultrasound-guided prostate biopsies according to a standardized scheme.
SEMI	NEG	PMC5369881.xml	S62	Materials and methods	NEG	Hosmer–Lemeshow tests were used to assess the fitting goodness of the logistic models.
SEMI	NEG	PMC5369881.xml	S91	Results	NEG	Next, bootstrapping was performed to reanalyze the data and determine the distribution and CIs for the AUC, and Hosmer–Lemeshow tests were used to calculate P values (Table 3, Figs. 2F–J, 3F–J).
SEMI	NEG	PMC5369882.xml	S26		NEG	Although no large-scale, multi-centered RCTs were available to address the issue, several studies based on HCC patients with more tumor numbers, larger tumor size, and vascular invasion were in favor of adjuvant TACE.[10,12–15]
SEMI	NEG	PMC5369882.xml	S29		NEG	In various cancer types, nomograms predicted prognosis more accurate than conventional staging systems.[19–22]

SEMI	NEG	PMC5369885.xml	S133	Discussion	NEG	The SD of the experimental groups is lower than that of the control group and the SNR is higher than that of the control group, indicating that the SAFIRE iterative reconstruction algorithm can reduce the noise level and improve the SNR simultaneously.
SEMI	POS	PMC5369885.xml	S143	Discussion	POS	However, this study has some limitations.
SEMI	POS	PMC5369885.xml	S144	Discussion	POS	For example, no measurement and analysis of the detailed morphology of lesions and CT value were performed.

SEMI	NEG	PMC5369887.xml	S72	Materials and methods	NEG	The difference in percentage change of each dosage group was compared using one-way ANOVA and the comparison of 2 groups was done by Tukey post analysis.
SEMI	NEG	PMC5369887.xml	S89	Results	NEG	The HR after intubation was significantly higher than the baseline HR in all groups (P < 0.001).
SEMI	NEG	PMC5369887.xml	S95	Results	NEG	To achieve the same effect in 50% of the patients (ED50), the required dose was 0.020 mg/kg (95% CI, −0.037 to 0.049).
SEMI	NEG	PMC5369887.xml	S98	Results	NEG	The ED50 for preventing an increase of HR to more than 20% over the baseline level was far more than our experimental dose.

SEMI	NEG	PMC5369887.xml	S102	Discussion	NEG	We demonstrated that the use of IV oxycodone, even at dosages higher than 0.1 mg/kg, led to an attenuation of the percentage increase in HR and MAP during endotracheal intubation using thiopental in healthy patients.
SEMI	POS	PMC5369887.xml	S137	Discussion	POS	The present study had several limitations.
SEMI	POS	PMC5369887.xml	S138	Discussion	POS	First, the enrolled patients were all healthy (ASA class 1), without any serious underlying disease.
SEMI	POS	PMC5369887.xml	S139	Discussion	POS	As the hemodynamic response during induction of general anesthesia is different based on the presence of underlying factors, especially hypertension and age, the amount of opioid will need to be adjusted in these populations.

SEMI	POS	PMC5369887.xml	S141	Discussion	POS	The hemodynamics will be different when using other induction agents, like propofol.
SEMI	POS	PMC5369887.xml	S142	Discussion	POS	Therefore, our results are not applicable to different protocols of induction for general anesthesia.
SEMI	POS	PMC5369887.xml	S143	Discussion	POS	However, by comparing the typical dosage of fentanyl with other induction agents, an adequate dose of oxycodone could also be determined from our study.

SEMI	POS	PMC5369890.xml	S112	Discussion	POS	Despite revealing the efficacy and safety of remifentanil for ECV in nulliparous women at term, this study still has several limitations.
SEMI	POS	PMC5369890.xml	S113	Discussion	POS	First, this study was conducted only at the People's Hospital of Xinjiang Uygur Autonomous Region, and most of the participants were Uyghur Chinese, which may have an influence on the generalizability of our findings to patients in other hospitals and of other ethnicities.
SEMI	POS	PMC5369890.xml	S114	Discussion	POS	Second, pain relief was evaluated by using the VAS, which is a subjective tool and may be affected by multiple unknown factors.

The proportional test was utilized to compare the present study with that by Hanci et al. The result of unrelieved rate under investigation was z = 0.77 (P > 0.05).
SEMI	NEG	PMC5369893.xml	S165	Discussion	NEG	Comparing the inclusion conditions of this study with the previous 3, the authentic effect of PRP could be noticed in terms of VAS and MIO because the patients had not received any treatment prior to PRP injection.

SEMI	POS	PMC5369906.xml	S153		POS	A modified Mayo score and the Harvey–Bradshaw Index were used as indicators of UC disease activity and CD disease activity, respectively, but they also have drawbacks and may be affected by the subjective descriptions provided by patients.

SEMI	POS	PMC5369921.xml	S189	Discussion	POS	The present study has both strengths and limitations.
SEMI	POS	PMC5369921.xml	S190	Discussion	POS	Its major strength is the large number of participants drawn from a nationwide cross-sectional study with stratified, multiclustered sampling.
SEMI	POS	PMC5369921.xml	S191	Discussion	POS	A limitation of this study is that we did not consider seasonal variations.
SEMI	POS	PMC5369921.xml	S192	Discussion	POS	Occupational exposure to allergens, noxious chemicals, and irritants such as wind, dirt, and air pollution is known to be associated with pterygium, but we did not consider it in this study.

SEMI	NEG	PMC5369922.xml	S112	Discussion	NEG	Because this is the first study evaluating the effectiveness of FD in determining changes in the finger joints in patients with RA in this manner, it is not possible to compare the study's results directly with previous scientific literature.
SEMI	NEG	PMC5369923.xml	S118	Discussion	NEG	The emergency physician withdrew rifampicin and pyrazinamide, and the patient was administered oral antihistamines and local steroid treatment.
SEMI	NEG	PMC5369923.xml	S122	Discussion	NEG	Therefore, a dermatologist should be consulted on suspicion of a severe adverse drug reaction to avoid delayed diagnosis.
SEMI	NEG	PMC5369923.xml	S126	Discussion	NEG	In the present case, considering the possible adverse effects on his pulmonary tuberculosis and gastrointestinal tract, systemic steroids were not administered on admission, which is probably the 2nd cause of the worsening of his condition.
SEMI	NEG	PMC5369923.xml	S138	Discussion	NEG	Additionally, systemic causes such as use of corticosteroids, intravenous drug abuse, tuberculosis, diabetes, and cancers, can predispose to infectious complications.[19]
SEMI	NEG	PMC5369924.xml	S154	Discussion	NEG	They concluded that increasing dietary Mg intake is associated with a reduced risk of stroke, heart failure, diabetes, and all-cause mortality, but not coronary heart disease or total cerebrovascular disease.
SEMI	NEG	PMC5369924.xml	S162	Discussion	NEG	Consistent with our study also Solati et al[30] showed a significant reduction in LDL in Mg-treated diabetic patients.
SEMI	POS	PMC5369924.xml	S169	Limitations	POS	There are some limitations in our study like limited number of patients, limited resources that enabled us only to focus on serum Mg level, glycemic control, and lipid profile but did not allow us to measure other metabolic parameters that would help us like adiponectin, leptin, and insulin like growth factor 1.
SEMI	POS	PMC5369924.xml	S170	Limitations	POS	We recommend performing further multicenter studies on different populations with different levels of glycemic control to support our findings.

SEMI	NEG	PMC5369925.xml	S137	Discussion	NEG	Statistical differences were found in daily IT morphine dose until 3 months after procedure, with a <1-fold increase during the 6.97 ± 2.83–month follow-up duration (Table 3), consistent with previously reported results.[22]
SEMI	NEG	PMC5369926.xml	S17	Abstract	NEG	In a multiple linear regression analysis, group assignment independently influenced OSATS scores, whereas sex, handedness, sports activities, and type of curriculum were not independently associated with OSATS scores.
SEMI	NEG	PMC5369926.xml	S33	Introduction	NEG	Since surgical and manual obstetric techniques such as hysteroscopy, resolution of a shoulder dystocia, and vaginal delivery for breech presentation can be effectively trained with dummy models,[12–16] it is reasonable to assume that dummy trainings for VE may also be effective.
SEMI	NEG	PMC5369926.xml	S62	Methods	NEG	In this 30-minute training video, 1 of the authors (C.T.) acts as an expert instructor, demonstrating all 40 steps of performing a VE according to the OSATS checklist used in this study (Table 1).

SEMI	POS	PMC5369926.xml	S142	Discussion	POS	First, we cannot report period.
SEMI	POS	PMC5369926.xml	S143	Discussion	POS	Therefore, we cannot exclude that the training effect may disappear over time.
SEMI	POS	PMC5369926.xml	S144	Discussion	POS	However, the beneficial effect of hands-on training was still visible after 4 days in our study, suggesting the presence of a delayed training effect after hands-on training.
SEMI	POS	PMC5369926.xml	S145	Discussion	POS	Based on the lack of longer follow-up data in our study, we cannot rule out that additional trainings may be necessary to achieve durable results in the long term.

SEMI	NEG	PMC5369927.xml	S47	Discussion	NEG	This patient had no symptoms related to appendix.
SEMI	NEG	PMC5369927.xml	S60	Conclusions	NEG	If an absent right colic artery and lymph node fusion is noted intraoperatively, then we should pay attention to the appendix because tumor might present when the appendix is congested, thickened, or firm.
SEMI	NEG	PMC5369928.xml	S85	Results	NEG	In addition, the weak immunohistochemistry staining (− or +) for Syn (P = 0.037) and CgA (P = 0.011) also correlated with the improved median overall survival, compared with the strongly positive staining (++ and +++) (Fig. 2, Syn, CgA).
SEMI	NEG	PMC5369928.xml	S90	Results	NEG	Surprisingly, the univariate analysis did not identify chemotherapy (P = 0.76) or radiotherapy (P = 0.447) as prognostic factors for the overall survival in the whole cohort of patients.
SEMI	NEG	PMC5369928.xml	S124	Discussion	NEG	However, the efficacy of surgery and combined adjuvant therapy (chemotherapy, radiotherapy, or chemoradiation therapy) for local and systemic controls may be different in NECUC patients with the different stages and different tumor histology.
SEMI	NEG	PMC5369928.xml	S125	Discussion	NEG	In fact, radical surgery is identified as an important method for local control in limited disease SCLC[27] and in SCCC.[1,28]

SEMI	NEG	PMC5369931.xml	S50	Discussion	NEG	These techniques, however, remain controversial due to the problems of delay or absence of hypertrophy and tumor progression related to the formation of intrahepatic vascular collaterals.[6,8]
SEMI	NEG	PMC5369931.xml	S61	Discussion	NEG	It is estimated that there are nearly 25% of colorectal cancer patients have liver metastases at presentation.[16]

SEMI	NEG	PMC5369932.xml	S139	Discussion	NEG	On the other hand, we observed a significant negative association between IL1-RA allele I and febrile seizure suggesting that allele I was in some fashion protective against febrile seizures.
SEMI	NEG	PMC5369932.xml	S149	Discussion	NEG	When patients with familial and sporadic febrile seizures were evaluated separately, we did not observe any significant association between IL-1β or IL-1 RA polymorphisms and a positive family history of FSs among our patients, which was contrary to our expectations and to Serdaroğlu et al[19] who added that the IL-1β -511T allele was observed to be more frequent in familial cases which comprised a risk factor for febrile seizure.

SEMI	NEG	PMC5369938.xml	S20	Introduction	NEG	In addition, the increased use of diagnostic CT scans has led to the increased detection of ITNs.[1]
SEMI	NEG	PMC5369938.xml	S26	Introduction	NEG	However, radiologists’ reporting practices vary widely.[9,11]
SEMI	NEG	PMC5369938.xml	S28	Introduction	NEG	The management of ITNs presently remains unclear.
SEMI	NEG	PMC5369938.xml	S40	Materials and methods	NEG	Patients with ITNs were identified through a radiologic report search, by using the search terms “thyroid nodule” and/or “thyroid lesion.” A patient was excluded if he or she had a history of any thyroid disease, such as “thyroid cancer,” “thyroid carcinoma,” “papillary carcinoma,” “medullary carcinoma,” or “follicular carcinoma” or had undergone a prior thyroid evaluation via ultrasound or fine-needle aspiration (FNA).
SEMI	NEG	PMC5369938.xml	S51	Materials and methods	NEG	ITNs on CT scans were reviewed with respect to size, multiplicity, attenuation, shape, and presence of calcification.
SEMI	NEG	PMC5369938.xml	S94	Results	NEG	Thirty-three malignancies were identified in the final pathology reports of patients who underwent surgery; 2 patients had received benign pathologic results from preoperative FNA.
SEMI	NEG	PMC5369938.xml	S115	Results	NEG	The malignancy rates according to CT slice number were 0% (0/16) with single-slice scans, 2.8% (50/1807) with 16-slice scans, and 1.3% (12/910) with 64-slice scans (P = 0.047).
SEMI	NEG	PMC5369938.xml	S141	Discussion	NEG	Radiologists who interpret CT scans including thyroid scans, in daily practice encounter ITNs and therefore face the issue of how best to report and manage these lesions.
SEMI	NEG	PMC5369938.xml	S149	Discussion	NEG	In our study, the prevalence of ITNs on thoracic CECT was 4.5% (95% CI, 4.3–4.7%), according to radiologic reports.
SEMI	NEG	PMC5369938.xml	S159	Discussion	NEG	These results support the need for reliable guidelines for reporting ITNs detected on CT.
SEMI	NEG	PMC5369938.xml	S167	Discussion	NEG	Several studies have reported various malignancy rates among ITNs identified using CT or magnetic resonance imaging and used FNA, core needle biopsy, or surgery, as the technique to diagnose malignancy.[5–7,10]
SEMI	NEG	PMC5369938.xml	S169	Discussion	NEG	In our study, 2 surgical patients with suspected malignancies according to cytological results were found to have benign disease.
SEMI	NEG	PMC5369938.xml	S189	Discussion	NEG	In addition to these factors, our study demonstrated through a multivariable analysis that decisions regarding additional workups for ITNs were influenced by multiple factors, including demographic factors (e.g., female sex, younger patient age), imaging features of ITNs (larger nodule size, AP/T ratio >1.0, presence of calcification, and heterogeneous attenuation vs.
SEMI	NEG	PMC5369938.xml	S202	Discussion	NEG	Among various factors evaluated in our study, imaging features such as calcification, shape, and attenuation of the ITN were important contributing factors with relatively high odds ratios, suggesting significant associations of these factors with the performance of additional workups.
SEMI	NEG	PMC5369938.xml	S212	Discussion	NEG	Although patients with malignant nodules were more frequently younger and had a larger nodule size, those differences were not statistically significant (P > 0.05).
SEMI	POS	PMC5369938.xml	S213	Discussion	POS	This study had several limitations.
SEMI	POS	PMC5369938.xml	S214	Discussion	POS	First, this was a retrospective study at a single institution.
SEMI	POS	PMC5369938.xml	S215	Discussion	POS	The ITN reporting style was specific to the radiologists at our institution.
SEMI	POS	PMC5369938.xml	S216	Discussion	POS	Second, the text report search underestimated the number of ITNs.
SEMI	POS	PMC5369938.xml	S217	Discussion	POS	We used the search terms “thyroid nodule” and “thyroid lesion,” but did not include other related terms such as “mass.” Third, some patients with ITNs might have been lost to follow-up, leading to underestimation of the number of malignant nodules.
SEMI	POS	PMC5369938.xml	S218	Discussion	POS	Fourth, some nodules with insufficient or unsatisfactory cytologic results were categorized as non-malignant nodules.
SEMI	POS	PMC5369938.xml	S219	Discussion	POS	Although these nodules comprised a minority (17/280, 6.1%) of non-malignant nodules, they might have affected our results.
SEMI	POS	PMC5369938.xml	S220	Discussion	POS	Fifth, all patients with ITNs who underwent ultrasound workups did not receive confirmed pathologic diagnoses.
SEMI	POS	PMC5369938.xml	S221	Discussion	POS	In addition, not all final diagnoses of ITNs were based on surgical pathology; some were based only on cytology.
SEMI	POS	PMC5369938.xml	S222	Discussion	POS	Furthermore, the final pathologic diagnoses of some nodules changed after surgery.
SEMI	POS	PMC5369938.xml	S223	Discussion	POS	However, it is not a current standard practice to surgically confirm the diagnoses of ITNs with benign cytological results.
SEMI	POS	PMC5369938.xml	S224	Discussion	POS	In addition, although many clinicians are interested in imaging feature for indetermidiate stage such as atypia of undetermined significance or follicular lesion of undetermined significance, unfortunately, analyzing the borderline cytologic data cannot perform because there were a few cases.
SEMI	POS	PMC5369938.xml	S225	Discussion	POS	Therefore, further evaluation with correlation between variable pathologic type and CT feature will be needed.
SEMI	POS	PMC5369938.xml	S226	Discussion	POS	Finally, our study only considered imaging characteristics of malignant ITNs without attention for specific histological or cytological data.
SEMI	POS	PMC5369938.xml	S227	Discussion	POS	However, there was not enough case that correlation between malignant imaging feature, such as calcification, and histological type.
SEMI	POS	PMC5369938.xml	S228	Discussion	POS	Actually, our result shows total 63 malignant nodules almost papillary carcinoma, except for six metastatic nodules and only papillary carcinoma has calcification.
SEMI	POS	PMC5369938.xml	S229	Discussion	POS	Although we did not compared with histological type and imaging feature, the fact that calcification were found in only papillary carcinoma on CT scan, may be meaningful result.
SEMI	NEG	PMC5369939.xml	S4	Abstract	NEG	Slow transit constipation (STC) is a common disease of which the etiology is still not clear.
SEMI	NEG	PMC5369939.xml	S25	Introduction	NEG	However, no studies have been performed regarding the pelvic parasympathetic colonic nerve.
SEMI	NEG	PMC5369939.xml	S47	Discussion	NEG	Apart from the enteric nerves, the pelvic parasympathetic colonic nerves also play an important role in controlling colonic motor function, and have been suspected as another etiological factor of STC.
SEMI	NEG	PMC5369939.xml	S49	Discussion	NEG	A number of patients develop STC after pelvic surgery[11] or childbirth,[12] both of which might lead to injury of pelvic parasympathetic nerves.
SEMI	NEG	PMC5369940.xml	S4	Abstract	NEG	We conduct 2 rounds of the Delphi process with 17 panel members using a developed draft of tentative activities for publicness including 5 main categories covering 27 items.
SEMI	NEG	PMC5369940.xml	S10	Abstract	NEG	Throughout results, we were able to define the activities of the PCH that encompassed its publicness and confirm that there are “good deficits” in the context of the PCHs.
SEMI	NEG	PMC5369940.xml	S55	Methods	NEG	The panel is comprised of 17 people; 2 scholars in academia, 2 CEOs of PCHs, 2 local government representatives, 2 members of special interest groups, such as the Korea Hospital Association and a consulting company, 3 representatives of nongovernment organizations, 2 journalists, and 1 individual from an agency operated by the government.
SEMI	NEG	PMC5369940.xml	S96	Results	NEG	Each of their proportion of support from the government was marked at 50%.
SEMI	NEG	PMC5369941.xml	S24	Introduction	NEG	MD is the leading cause of adult blindness in industrialized countries and it affects approximately 6 million persons globally.[2]

SEMI	NEG	PMC5369941.xml	S122	Discussion	NEG	Both organs have rich vascular networks.
SEMI	NEG	PMC5369941.xml	S126	Discussion	NEG	An animal model using transgenic mouse with high expression of CFH, demonstrated a dose-dependent protective effect in the function and structure of both eye and renal abnormalities.[22]
SEMI	NEG	PMC5369942.xml	S53	Abstract	NEG	The mean size of the resected glands was 4.6 mm.
SEMI	NEG	PMC5369942.xml	S20	Introduction	NEG	A number of previous studies have investigated unintentional parathyroidectomy during thyroid surgery,[4–6] but there is no consensus about its incidence and risk factors; moreover, most of these studies describe different types of thyroid surgery.
SEMI	NEG	PMC5369942.xml	S44	Methods	NEG	The χ2 test, Fisher exact, or t test were used to assess these variables and all statistical analyses were performed by SPSS 13.0.
SEMI	NEG	PMC5369942.xml	S56	Results	NEG	As described in Table 1, in patients requiring additional unilateral or bilateral neck dissection, 26 (18.9%) cases had incidental parathyroidectomy; in patients without additional unilateral or bilateral neck dissection, 9 (4.4%) cases had incidental parathyroidectomy, the difference was significant (P < 0.001).
SEMI	NEG	PMC5371398.xml	S12	Objectives	NEG	Similar associations were seen with anti-CCP positivity in SE-positive participants (OR 0.42, 95% CI 0.20 to 0.89), but not SE-negative participants.
SEMI	NEG	PMC5371436.xml	S96		NEG	Lymphocytes were identified based on their scatter pattern, and CD3+, CD8-, CD4+ cells were considered as CD4 T cells, whereas CD3+, CD8+, CD4- cells were considered as CD8 T cells.
SEMI	NEG	PMC5371436.xml	S154		NEG	In addition, none of the immune activation markers nor CD4+ T cell counts showed a significant correlation with any of the PCoA axes (data not shown) in any sampling site type.
SEMI	NEG	PMC5371436.xml	S175		NEG	Only one of them was enriched in Tannerella and Porphyromonas and associated to PD severity.[38]
SEMI	NEG	PMC5371436.xml	S183		NEG	Although, in our dataset, HIV infection was enriched in men who had sex with men, this factor alone had a small effect on the oral microbiome structure (adonis test R2 = 0.02, Pr (>F) = 0.032) and the age and sexual behavior adjusted model provided a similar picture in bacterial differential abundance than the unadjusted one.
SEMI	NEG	PMC5371437.xml	S11	Abstract	NEG	There was a decreased incidence of anastomotic leakage (1[0.9] vs 7[6.5]; P = 0.033) and postoperative ileuas (5[4.6%] vs 11[10.2%]; P = 0.096) in the HS administration patients.
SEMI	NEG	PMC5371437.xml	S24	Introduction	NEG	This was evidenced by a significant lower pulmonary microvascular permeability, wet-to-dry lung weight ratio, and improved arterial blood gases.
SEMI	NEG	PMC5371437.xml	S53	Materials and methods	NEG	Infectious complications were confirmed with microbiological analyses and positive cultures and included pneumonia (radiographic confirmation) and abdominal, urinary, or systemic infections (fever [oral temperature >38.5°C]).
SEMI	NEG	PMC5371437.xml	S77	Materials and methods	NEG	Student's t-test was used to compare normally distributed continuous variables, and the Mann–Whitney U test was used to compare abnormally distributed variables.
SEMI	NEG	PMC5371438.xml	S17	Introduction	NEG	About 75% to 80% of HCC cases are caused by chronic hepatitis B virus (HBV) or hepatitis C virus infection.[1]
SEMI	NEG	PMC5371438.xml	S38	Methods	NEG	CHB patients were defined as chronic HBV-infected patients with abnormal liver biochemical parameters (intermittent or persistent elevations of bilirubin or aminotransferases), and no evidence of HCC or liver cirrhosis.
SEMI	NEG	PMC5371438.xml	S52	Methods	NEG	A NanoDrop spectrophotometer was used to measure the DNA concentration.
SEMI	NEG	PMC5371438.xml	S81	Results	NEG	Sex and age did not differ significantly among the 3 groups (P > 0.05).
SEMI	POS	PMC5371438.xml	S134	Discussion	POS	There are 3 limitations of this study that should be taken into consideration.
SEMI	POS	PMC5371438.xml	S135	Discussion	POS	First, all included individuals (HC, N-HCC, and HCC patients) were recruited from only 1 hospital, which might result in selection bias.
SEMI	POS	PMC5371438.xml	S136	Discussion	POS	However, the distributions of all genotypes were in accordance with Hardy–Weinberg equilibrium in the HC group, except for 2 SNPs (rs2293302 from CTNNB1 and rs733153 from WNT2), which revealed that our subjects might be a good representation of the general population.
SEMI	POS	PMC5371438.xml	S137	Discussion	POS	Second, our study had a relatively small sample size, which might reduce the ability to find differences among groups in statistical analysis.
SEMI	POS	PMC5371438.xml	S138	Discussion	POS	Third, our study was a retrospective study, which had a less power to assess the risk of HCC development than a prospective study, in particular in cirrhotic HBV-infected patients (at high risk for liver cancer).
SEMI	NEG	PMC5371438.xml	S141	Conclusion	NEG	In conclusion, we found that polymorphisms in the Wnt/β-catenin signaling pathway genes (CTNNB1 and WNT2) are associated with HCC susceptibility and progression.
SEMI	NEG	PMC5371439.xml	S22	Introduction	NEG	A study in China[13] revealed that a resin HP apparatus (RHA) can effectively remove iPTH and serum retinol-binding protein, and markedly improve skin itching.
SEMI	NEG	PMC5371439.xml	S38	Introduction	NEG	The DOPPS I and DOPPS II reveal that, in MHD patients with UP, 42% to 45% patients have moderate to severe itching.[17]
SEMI	NEG	PMC5371439.xml	S47	Introduction	NEG	By comparing the structural and functional characteristics between HA130-RHA and HA330-RHA, it was found that the former has structural characteristics mainly for the relative specific absorption of moderate- and macromolecular weight toxins produced in uremia, and that the removal of PTH and β2-MG was the most prominent.
SEMI	NEG	PMC5371439.xml	S95	Materials and methods	NEG	Before and 4 and 8 weeks after treatment, itching was evaluated by visual analogue scale (VAS)[26] and modified Duo pruritus scores.[27]
SEMI	NEG	PMC5371440.xml	S6	Abstract	NEG	A matched case–control study was undertaken using data from the UK-Clinical Practice Research Datalink.
SEMI	NEG	PMC5371440.xml	S74	Methods	NEG	Unadjusted conditional logistic regression was used to assess the association between oral bisphosphonate prescriptions and incident acute pseudogout status in all analyses.
SEMI	NEG	PMC5371440.xml	S94	Results	NEG	Eighty-four pseudogout cases (4.2%) received a prescription for alendronic acid in the 60-day period preceding the index date compared with 211 (2.6%) controls (adjusted IRR 1.36; 95% CI 1.03–1.79).
SEMI	NEG	PMC5371440.xml	S140	Discussion	NEG	Fourth, there remains a possibility of residual confounding.
SEMI	NEG	PMC5371441.xml	S34	Introduction	NEG	The aim of this study was to investigate liver function and early signs of liver disease at the age of approximately 38 years in this cohort of PiZZ and PiSZ individuals, in comparison with a matched control group randomly selected from the population registry.
SEMI	NEG	PMC5371441.xml	S99	Results	NEG	When only contraceptive treatment was included in the analysis, the difference was still significant (P = 0.047).
SEMI	NEG	PMC5371441.xml	S119	Results	NEG	In contrast, the proportion of PiMM women with risk consumption was higher than that of PiZZ women.
SEMI	NEG	PMC5371441.xml	S159	Discussion	NEG	We found increased liver stiffness in the PiZZ men in comparison with PiMM men, but no significant differences were found in the female subgroups.
SEMI	NEG	PMC5371442.xml	S16		NEG	These patients are now essentially treated as outpatients.
SEMI	NEG	PMC5371442.xml	S18		NEG	In parallel, researchers have access to the large French health insurance databases, covering >98% of the French population.
SEMI	NEG	PMC5371442.xml	S36		NEG	Then, for hospital diagnoses and long-term conditions, a longer extraction period has to be used (2008–2013) to enable at least 24 months (2008–2010) or 12 months (2009–2010) of observation (and use of the first occurrence of MM diagnosis after this period as a proxy of diagnosis date).
SEMI	NEG	PMC5371442.xml	S41		NEG	Diagnoses are coded according to the International Classification of Diseases for Oncology, 3rd Edition (ICD-O-3).[11]
SEMI	NEG	PMC5371442.xml	S46		NEG	Clinical data were extracted for descriptive purposes.
SEMI	NEG	PMC5371442.xml	S58		NEG	LTD provision is dedicated to patients suffering from a chronic condition which requires long-term treatment or expensive drugs.
SEMI	NEG	PMC5371442.xml	S66		NEG	Linkage between both sources was done on the basis of combinations of 5 potential matching variables: family name, birth name, first name, date of birth, sex, place of birth (“commune,” lowest administrative area in France).
SEMI	NEG	PMC5371442.xml	S81		NEG	When designing an algorithm, we have to include either main, main + related, or all types of diagnosis.
SEMI	NEG	PMC5371442.xml	S86		NEG	This cumulative condition was introduced with a temporal condition, as diagnoses belonging to the same episode (including transfers) are likely to be affected by the same potential coding error.
SEMI	NEG	PMC5371442.xml	S87		NEG	True-positive patients were those ascertained as multiple myeloma cases in the registry (ICD-O code “9732/3,” “9731/3,” or “9734/3” in 2010–2013), and correctly identified as MM cases when applying the algorithm to health insurance data.
SEMI	NEG	PMC5371442.xml	S90		NEG	False-negative were those ascertained as MM cases in the registry, but not identified as MM cases according to the algorithm.
SEMI	NEG	PMC5371442.xml	S93		NEG	Youden index (sensitivity + specificity − 1) was computed as an indicator of model performance.
SEMI	NEG	PMC5371442.xml	S96		NEG	Statistical analyses were performed using SAS 9.4 (SAS Institute Inc, Cary, NC).
SEMI	NEG	PMC5371442.xml	S98		NEG	Concordance between date of diagnosis in the registry and first “C90”multiple myeloma code in LTD or hospital database was assessed using median time between date of diagnosis in the registry and first multiple myeloma “C90” code in number of days.
SEMI	NEG	PMC5371442.xml	S104		NEG	According to the characteristics presented Table 1, median age was 74 (interquartile range, 63–81) and 57% were male (n = 71).
SEMI	NEG	PMC5371442.xml	S107		NEG	Hospital data were available for 21,846 inhabitants of the Tarn area (2008–2013).
SEMI	NEG	PMC5371442.xml	S108		NEG	Data from the registry were obtained for 1069 patients.
SEMI	NEG	PMC5371442.xml	S115		NEG	Sensitivity was 70.4% (62.4%–78.4%) when using only main hospital diagnoses (specificity 99.9%, PPV 78.6%), 76.0% (68.5%–83.5%) when considering also related diagnoses (specificity 99.9%, PPV 74.2%), and 90.4% (85.2%–95.6%) with associated diagnoses included (99.7% specificity, 63.8% PPV).
SEMI	NEG	PMC5371442.xml	S116		NEG	Using a 12-month observation period (option B, Table 3) gave very close results, with similar sensitivity (90.4%) and slight differences visible for the PPV (59.5% vs.
SEMI	NEG	PMC5371442.xml	S122		NEG	However, the interest of long-term conditions was attenuated after integrating associated diagnoses (+6%), and disappeared in all algorithms integrating associated diagnoses (same value for sensitivity for algorithm with main, related or associated code [90%], with or without LTD, 12 or 24 months’ period).
SEMI	NEG	PMC5371442.xml	S141		NEG	All other false-positive patients were patients with hospital data, but not retrieved in the registry.
SEMI	NEG	PMC5371442.xml	S155		NEG	The same algorithm with a 24-month observation period demonstrated similar performance, but the algorithm with the shorter period of observation should be preferred.
SEMI	NEG	PMC5371442.xml	S157		NEG	Faced to these 2 algorithms with equal performances, we choose the one requiring the minimum data (i.e., with no participation of data from the LTD scheme).
SEMI	POS	PMC5371442.xml	S162		POS	Some limitations must be acknowledged.
SEMI	POS	PMC5371442.xml	S163		POS	First, this study was conducted in a single area and may not perfectly reflect the performance of hospital and LTD codes at the national level.
SEMI	POS	PMC5371442.xml	S164		POS	However, coding is quite similar in all private and public hospitals.
SEMI	POS	PMC5371442.xml	S165		POS	However, several data suggest that clinical and coding practices in Tarn region are very close to that of the whole nation.
SEMI	POS	PMC5371442.xml	S166		POS	According to national estimations, 51% of newly diagnosed MM (or proliferative disorders) were male, with 70% aged >65 years.
SEMI	POS	PMC5371442.xml	S167		POS	[1] In our study, 58% were male and 67% were older than 65 years.
SEMI	POS	PMC5371442.xml	S168		POS	Sex and gender characteristics are then quite close to the national reference.
SEMI	POS	PMC5371442.xml	S169		POS	Clinical features of the patients are not expected to be different in France, but might be acknowledged at the larger scale (i.e., at the European level) owing to different delay to diagnosis.
SEMI	POS	PMC5371442.xml	S170		POS	As we only used specific MM codes and not symptoms, the performance of our algorithm is not likely to be affected by the clinical aspect.
SEMI	POS	PMC5371442.xml	S171		POS	Concerning coding practices for health insurance data, there are national standards of coding PMSI data, for the choice of the principal diagnosis for instance.
SEMI	POS	PMC5371442.xml	S172		POS	Of course, we could not rule out various coding habits between hospitals or regions because of different interpretation of coding rules.
SEMI	POS	PMC5371442.xml	S173		POS	This study is then conducted with the assumption of similar coding practices in all hospitals.
SEMI	POS	PMC5371442.xml	S174		POS	However, in practice, quality of coding is regularly audited in public and private hospitals for reimbursement purposes.
SEMI	POS	PMC5371442.xml	S175		POS	Another potential limitation is related to the assumption that all patients with available data from the registry corresponding area and period should be considered as potential cases.
SEMI	POS	PMC5371442.xml	S176		POS	In other words, failure of linkage with administrative data meant that the patient had no LTD or hospital record for the period of interest.
SEMI	POS	PMC5371442.xml	S177		POS	However, even if there is systematic attempt to obtain cancer hospital data from all inhabitants of the covered area (Tarn), including hospitals outside the area of the residence, there is a possibility that hospital episodes were not complete, leading to underestimate the performance of the algorithm (increase in false-negative).
SEMI	POS	PMC5371442.xml	S178		POS	Differences were observed when matching records from the cancer registry and the 2 data sources (21,846 for hospital data vs.
SEMI	POS	PMC5371442.xml	S180		POS	These variations were expected.
SEMI	POS	PMC5371442.xml	S181		POS	Indeed, although coding of hospital episodes will be always performed, LTD status is not automatically assigned to a patient and has to be requested by a physician.
SEMI	POS	PMC5371442.xml	S182		POS	Then, the greater number of hospital records compared to LTD records should not be interpreted as missing information, but simply reflect the organization of the healthcare system.
SEMI	POS	PMC5371442.xml	S183		POS	In addition, the relative lack of sensitivity of the algorithm was expected owing to the particular natural history of multiple myeloma.
SEMI	POS	PMC5371442.xml	S184		POS	Indeed, patients are not systematically managed in hospital, nor treated after diagnosis, because of possible asymptomatic or smoldering disease.
SEMI	POS	PMC5371442.xml	S185		POS	Those patients are less likely to go to hospital or to enter in a long-term condition scheme.
SEMI	POS	PMC5371442.xml	S186		POS	Lack of sensitivity for identifying these patients could be problematic for epidemiological purposes, but is acceptable for healthcare use or pharmacoepidemiological research, as these patients are not healthcare users.
SEMI	POS	PMC5371442.xml	S187		POS	In this study, we focused on the need to accurately identify myeloma patients (specificity), which would undergo additional selection criteria to be included in pharmacoepidemiological study for instance.
SEMI	POS	PMC5371442.xml	S188		POS	Algorithms integrating treated patients would certainly have been more sensitive[17], but we did not have sufficient information in the registry to ascertain this.
SEMI	POS	PMC5371442.xml	S189		POS	Finally, lack of sensitivity is likely to be controlled in additional selection process, and the high specificity of the algorithm is an important strength here.
SEMI	NEG	PMC5371442.xml	S191		NEG	There would be a potential interest to require not only one but several diagnosis codes (“cumulative diagnoses” strategy) to overcome this issue.
SEMI	NEG	PMC5371442.xml	S192		NEG	Then, as expected, the increase in the number of diagnosis codes further improved specificity, but sensitivity reached unacceptable levels (<60%).
SEMI	NEG	PMC5371442.xml	S198		NEG	A work has also been implemented in French hospital data to select cancer related hospitalization, and myeloma was listed among the diseases of interest.[23]
SEMI	NEG	PMC5371442.xml	S203		NEG	However, literature concerning multiple myeloma is very poor, and only one resource could be identified.[34]
SEMI	NEG	PMC5371443.xml	S8	Abstract	NEG	Particularly when the diagnosis is late and little can be done.

SEMI	NEG	PMC5371444.xml	S10	Abstract	NEG	The forced expiratory volume in 1 second (FEV1) and peak expiratory flow (PEF) were detected, after which FEV1/forced vital capacity (FVC) was calculated before and after treatment.
SEMI	NEG	PMC5371444.xml	S30	Introduction	NEG	One-fourth of children with asthma have high risk of lung function loss, which attributes to exacerbation and severity of chronic asthma.[3]

SEMI	NEG	PMC5371445.xml	S109	Results	NEG	Of the vertigo cases, 9 (6.9%) had vertebral artery V1 segment tortuosity, and 17 (13.1%) had basilar artery tortuosity.
SEMI	NEG	PMC5371445.xml	S139	Discussion	NEG	However, in the literature, a relationship between vertebrobasilar artery hypoplasia and posterior circulatory strokes has been reported.[19,20]
SEMI	NEG	PMC5371446.xml	S7	Abstract	NEG	Viral hepatitis prevalence was <1% (hepatitis B virus [HBV]: 13 children, 0.80%; hepatitis C virus: 1 child, 0.10%; hepatitis A virus: 6 children, 0.40%).
SEMI	NEG	PMC5371446.xml	S57	Materials and methods	NEG	Tuberculin skin test (TST) and QuantiFERON-TB-Gold In-Tube assay (QFT-G-IT) were performed, and a chest radiograph was executed if TST or QFT-G-IT were positive, according to the international guidelines definitions.[39–41]
SEMI	NEG	PMC5371446.xml	S129	Results	NEG	No significant, independent higher risk for parasitosis was evidenced considering age, sex, the interval between their arrival in Italy and their first clinical evaluation (< or ≥3 months), continent of origin, TB infection diagnosis, and QFT-G-IT (Table 4).
SEMI	NEG	PMC5371446.xml	S190	Discussion	NEG	In our study, we also observed a higher frequency (13.25% vs 9.15%) of TST+/QFT-G-IT− discordant results in children ≥5 years: this could be related to more prolonged exposure to TB cases in the country of origin (in the large majority of these countries TB is endemic) and to routinely repeated TST in orphanages.
SEMI	POS	PMC5371446.xml	S216	Discussion	POS	Our cross-sectional study had some limitations.
SEMI	POS	PMC5371446.xml	S217	Discussion	POS	Dividing the population into subgroups for analyses and comparisons led to limited subsets of patients.
SEMI	POS	PMC5371446.xml	S218	Discussion	POS	Furthermore, during the 7-year study period some investigations included in the screening protocol changed, and some tests were not performed in the whole population: in fact, the large majority of the children referred to our Center and included in the study were evaluated as per protocol, but for some variables we had some missing information possibly due to the physicians’ incomplete adherence to the screening protocol or to an incomplete collection of data in medical records.
SEMI	POS	PMC5371446.xml	S219	Discussion	POS	Indeed, it must be considered that our Center was able to visit only a part of all the adopted children arriving in our region, as some parents (despite the recommendation to see a doctor for all adopted children, regardless of their country of origin) may have consulted their family physician or no one at all.
SEMI	NEG	PMC5371447.xml	S6	Abstract	NEG	In the midline sagittal plane, the levels corresponding to the vocal cords, cricoid cartilage, suprasternal notch, manubriosternal junction, and carina were identified.

SEMI	NEG	PMC5371450.xml	S110	Discussion	NEG	Previously, some small-scale studies suggest that APRI and FIB-4 scores are higher in CHB patients with significant fibrosis,[23,24] which we also observed in this study.
SEMI	POS	PMC5371450.xml	S144	Discussion	POS	First, the retrospective design of this study might have caused selective bias resulting in underestimated sensitivity and overestimated specificity of APRI and FIB-4.[28] Second, in this study, the case number of cirrhosis was limited (17, 7.2%), which could have resulted in statistical bias when we evaluated and compared the performances of APRI and FIB-4 for the diagnosis of cirrhosis.
SEMI	POS	PMC5371450.xml	S145	Discussion	POS	Therefore, larger sample, prospective, multicentre studies will be necessary to validate the new cut-offs of APRI and FIB-4.

SEMI	NEG	PMC5371453.xml	S20	Introduction	NEG	Moreover Roux-en-Y gastric bypass is getting the new surgical treatment of choice in obese patients with GERD,[2] while gastric bypass surgery shows efficacy similar to that of traditional laparoscopic antireflux surgery in the control of GERD.[3]
SEMI	NEG	PMC5371453.xml	S29	Introduction	NEG	However, none of these theories is proven and none can explain the considerable time delay from surgery to the appearance of symptoms.
SEMI	NEG	PMC5371453.xml	S42	Case presentation and management	NEG	Diagnosis of symptomatic hyperinsulinemic hypoglycemia was made using the Sigstad score questionnaire,[17] an oral glucose tolerance test (OGTT) (Accu-Chek Dextro OGT Roche, Switzerland), and a continuous glucose measurement (CGM) (Dexcom G4 Nintamed, San Diego, California).

SEMI	NEG	PMC5371454.xml	S25	Introduction	NEG	The second is early treatment.
SEMI	NEG	PMC5371454.xml	S26	Introduction	NEG	Early treatment of DKD aims at reducing the frequency or delaying the occurrence of macroalbuminuria in patients who have microalbuminuria.
SEMI	NEG	PMC5371454.xml	S28	Introduction	NEG	However, the effectiveness of the treatment is less than satisfactory in clinic.
SEMI	NEG	PMC5371454.xml	S30	Introduction	NEG	It is reported that the emergency of overt proteinuria predicts the accelerating progression of DKD, so controlling and minimizing proteinuria has been the key point to delay the progression of DKD.
SEMI	NEG	PMC5371454.xml	S91	Methods	NEG	In this study, we have reported only the medical records and statistical results, not including the patients’ privacy information, so we think it did not touch on benefits and harms of patients and ethical approval and written patient consent was not necessary.
SEMI	NEG	PMC5371454.xml	S118	Results	NEG	The judgment of effectiveness was based on the baseline.
SEMI	NEG	PMC5371454.xml	S122	Results	NEG	The results are recorded in Table 3.
SEMI	NEG	PMC5371454.xml	S151	Discussion	NEG	In this study, the main symptoms of DKD with overt proteinuria were shortness of breath and fatigue, numbness of limbs, insomnia, blurred vision, nocturia, edema, low back pain, constipation, itch or ulcer of skin, and chills.
SEMI	NEG	PMC5371454.xml	S160	Discussion	NEG	The symptom of nocturia is common when long-standing disease leads to impaired kidney collateral and renal tubular dysfunction.
SEMI	NEG	PMC5371454.xml	S173	Discussion	NEG	Dan Shen (Salvia) supplies blood and quickens the blood.
SEMI	NEG	PMC5371454.xml	S184	Discussion	NEG	Effects on blood lipid, BP, blood sugar, and serum UA can reflect the advantage of individualized treatment and comprehensive regulation TCMs offer.
SEMI	POS	PMC5371454.xml	S197	Limitations	POS	Our study was just a retrospective, small-sample, single-center trial, and has many limitations: first, it is a retrospective study based on real-world data, with the inherent potential for bias and omission of important data.
SEMI	POS	PMC5371454.xml	S198	Limitations	POS	Second, the study is not strictly controlled for therapeutic measures or lifestyle modification that, in addition to modified Shenzhuo formula, might have affected patients’ clinical course.

SEMI	POS	PMC5371454.xml	S200	Limitations	POS	These limitations highlight the need for rigorously controlled, prospective studies of the effects of the modified Shenzhuo formula in the management of DKD.
SEMI	POS	PMC5371454.xml	S201	Limitations	POS	In fact, we are conducting a double-blind, double-simulation, randomized control trial of Shenzhuo formula in the overt proteinuria stage of DKD.
SEMI	POS	PMC5371454.xml	S202	Limitations	POS	The research, which has been registered in the Chinese Clinical Trial Registry, will test the validity and feasibility of using a TCM as an alternative in the treatment of DKD.
SEMI	POS	PMC5371454.xml	S203	Limitations	POS	Modern medicine advocates the following 5 kinds of preventive and therapeutic measures for DKD: lifestyle modification, control of blood glucose, control of BP, correction of disorders of lipid metabolism, and renal replacement therapy.
SEMI	POS	PMC5371454.xml	S204	Limitations	POS	High-quality studies have shown that strict control of blood glucose, BP, and blood lipids can prevent the emergence of microproteinuria and delay the deterioration of renal function,[35–41] but there is no conclusive evidence that any of these measures significantly reduces the amount of proteinuria in patients with DKD.
SEMI	POS	PMC5371454.xml	S205	Limitations	POS	In the quest for new preventive and treatment measures for DKD, we feel that traditional Chinese medications should be considered.
SEMI	POS	PMC5371454.xml	S206	Limitations	POS	The traditional medications have a rich, 1000-year history in the treatment of diabetes mellitus and DKD and therefore form the basis for future research.
SEMI	POS	PMC5371454.xml	S207	Limitations	POS	The results of this study suggest that Shenzhuo formula, through its effects on blood sugar, BP, and serum lipids, can reduce 24-hour urinary protein excretion, delay the deterioration of renal function, and improve the main symptoms of patients over a long time period.
SEMI	POS	PMC5371454.xml	S208	Limitations	POS	TCM has the potential advantage of targeting multiple facets of the disease and comprehensively improving patients’ symptoms and quality of life.[42–46]

SEMI	POS	PMC5371455.xml	S121	Discussion	POS	This study had several limitations.
SEMI	POS	PMC5371455.xml	S122	Discussion	POS	Owing to a respective study, selection and information bias exist, and this may lead to less-strong evidence.
SEMI	POS	PMC5371455.xml	S123	Discussion	POS	In addition, the study sample size is relatively small, and the operations were performed in 1 center.

SEMI	NEG	PMC5371456.xml	S6	Abstract	NEG	Five-hundred twenty-nine employees who had worked at sewing, ironing, and as managers at 12 clothing manufacturing factories were studied.
SEMI	NEG	PMC5371456.xml	S9	Abstract	NEG	Among employees in Chinese clothing industry, sewers and ironing workers had a higher 1-year prevalence of CD than managers.
SEMI	NEG	PMC5371456.xml	S10	Abstract	NEG	It is noteworthy that exposure to leather and feather materials and the types of manual work are associated with CD, as well as dry skin and allergic rhinitis.
SEMI	NEG	PMC5371456.xml	S18	Introduction	NEG	Nevertheless, studies on textile and garment dermatitis have only been undertaken among registered patients,[5,10,11] literature related to OCD of employees in the Chinese clothing industry is very limited.
SEMI	NEG	PMC5371456.xml	S36	Methods	NEG	Figure 1 presented a flowchart of the study population.
SEMI	NEG	PMC5371456.xml	S48	Methods	NEG	A modified version of NOSQ that collects data on the prevalence of OSD as a questionnaire based on self-reported diagnoses seemed to be a good tool.[17,21]
SEMI	NEG	PMC5371456.xml	S69	Methods	NEG	Categorical variables are presented as numbers and relative frequencies of respondents.
SEMI	NEG	PMC5371456.xml	S95	Results	NEG	The skin symptoms and the locations of the lesions in respondents with CD in the last year are shown in Table 3 according to their type of work.
SEMI	POS	PMC5371456.xml	S175	Discussion	POS	The limitations of the present study are that the inclusion was not based on random sampling but convenience sampling, which may cause a selection bias.
SEMI	POS	PMC5371456.xml	S176	Discussion	POS	In addition, more detailed analysis cannot be conducted because with more variables there is a worse statistical power on the premise of the same sample size.
SEMI	POS	PMC5371456.xml	S177	Discussion	POS	Because of the cross-sectional nature of the survey, a history of 1-year skin symptoms is prone to recall bias.
SEMI	POS	PMC5371456.xml	S178	Discussion	POS	Moreover, the representativeness of the study is limited to some extent because the targeted population is from small and medium-sized clothing factories in the Daxing District.
SEMI	POS	PMC5371456.xml	S179	Discussion	POS	Notwithstanding its limitations, first of all the survey was conducted to a targeted occupational population among the Chinese clothing population, whereas previous studies were based on the patient populations in clinics and registration of occupational people with OCD.
SEMI	POS	PMC5371456.xml	S180	Discussion	POS	Although the present study did not use random sampling, quota sampling was used on the basis of regional division, and convenience sampling was adopted at each area.

SEMI	NEG	PMC5371457.xml	S155		NEG	Strassburg et al[31] suggested that the assessment of MRF status based on preoperative MRI could be used as an individualized indication of PCRT.
SEMI	POS	PMC5371457.xml	S159		POS	Our study had several limitations.
SEMI	POS	PMC5371457.xml	S160		POS	First, the study cohort was small, and the design was a case-matched retrospective analysis.
SEMI	POS	PMC5371457.xml	S161		POS	Additional case-matching covariates could not be applied because of small numbers in the study cohort.
SEMI	POS	PMC5371457.xml	S162		POS	Although adjuvant therapy may have an effect on the prognosis, the present study did not consider it as a case-matching covariate.[33]

SEMI	NEG	PMC5371458.xml	S97		NEG	Groups were differentiated on the basis of stroke severity as determined by mRS score; patients were categorized into 3 groups as follows: mild (mRS score improvement from 1 to 0 following stenting; n = 13), moderate (mRS score change from 2 to 1; n = 18), and severe (mRS score change from 4 to 3; n = 10).
SEMI	NEG	PMC5371458.xml	S131		NEG	This indicates that lower net contralateral ICA values measured in the peristenting period may be predictive of positive outcomes at 12-month follow-up, whereas higher values are less likely to be associated with improvement in mRS score at 12 months.
SEMI	NEG	PMC5371459.xml	S16	Abstract	NEG	Mean Miyazaki scores were significantly higher in the vertigo group at C3/4 and C4/5 (P = 0.044 and P = 0.037).

SEMI	NEG	PMC5371461.xml	S15	Abstract	NEG	Arterial blood gases and sensorium levels improved significantly within 2 hours in the NPPV group with lower hospital mortality, fewer complications and invasive devices/patient, and superior weaning off mechanical ventilation.
SEMI	NEG	PMC5371461.xml	S26	Introduction	NEG	Noninvasive ventilatory support is an alternative approach to CMV that does not require endotracheal intubation (ETI) or the placement of a tracheostomy tube.
SEMI	NEG	PMC5371461.xml	S28	Introduction	NEG	NPPV utilizes positive pressure to deliver air/oxygen to the airways via an interface such as a face mask, nasal mask/plugs, or helmet.
SEMI	NEG	PMC5371461.xml	S32	Introduction	NEG	Unfortunately, there are currently no data on the use of these techniques in patients with HE and abundant secretions.[16]
SEMI	NEG	PMC5371461.xml	S56	Materials and methods	NEG	NPPV (Flexo ST30 ventilator, Curative Medical Inc, Santa Clara, CA) was delivered in spontaneous/timed mode with positive end-expiratory pressure (PEEP) via a well-fitting oronasal mask (ZS-MZ-A, Zhongshan, Shanghai, China) with the addition of a single-use heated humidifier (G-314001-0, Vadi Medical Technology Co Ltd, Taiwan, China).
SEMI	NEG	PMC5371461.xml	S87	Materials and methods	NEG	The standard therapeutic protocol was the same as that for the NPPV group except that the participants were sedated at the time of intubation with daily interruption of sedation (2 mg/kg propofol intravenously followed by a continuous infusion at 0.5–3 mg/kg/h, usually for 24–36 hours).[10]
SEMI	NEG	PMC5371461.xml	S156	Discussion	NEG	A novel aspect of the present study is that it used an OPA to facilitate the clearance of secretions during NPPV.
SEMI	NEG	PMC5371461.xml	S162	Discussion	NEG	Studies using radioactive-labeled enteral feeding have shown that cumulative endotracheal counts were higher for participants in the completely supine position (0°C) than in those in the semirecumbent position (45°C), suggesting that aspiration might be decreased by semirecumbent positioning.[40]
SEMI	POS	PMC5371461.xml	S175	Discussion	POS	The present study has several limitations.

SEMI	NEG	PMC5371463.xml	S96	Discussion	NEG	KOA is very common and the medial compartment is affected most frequently than other areas.[2,3]
SEMI	NEG	PMC5371464.xml	S14	Abstract	NEG	SoCSVV was usually associated with drugs and preceding infections.
SEMI	NEG	PMC5371464.xml	S16	Abstract	NEG	The more severe the skin involvement in the course of SoCSVV, the higher is the risk of recurrence.
SEMI	NEG	PMC5371464.xml	S69	Results	NEG	7.25 mg/dL, respectively; P < 0.05).
SEMI	NEG	PMC5371464.xml	S92	Discussion	NEG	Further studies are needed to establish whether early and more aggressive treatment (systemic steroids) in individuals with macules and SoCSVV may prevent ulcer formation.
SEMI	NEG	PMC5371465.xml	S58	Discussion	NEG	This is composed of thrombus, and therefore intramural hematoma cannot be considered very accurate.
SEMI	NEG	PMC5371465.xml	S70	Discussion	NEG	The neuroimaging diagnosis should be performed by MRI, computerized tomographic angiography (CTA), US, and DSA.
SEMI	NEG	PMC5371465.xml	S75	Discussion	NEG	However, US can make full use of its advantages in analyzing the reasons of occlusion in accordance to the wall and lumen.
SEMI	NEG	PMC5371465.xml	S83	Conclusion	NEG	We reported 2 cases of extracranial vertebral artery dissection onset and the process of diagnosis.
SEMI	NEG	PMC5371466.xml	S72	Methods	NEG	The age-adjusted association between UA and MetS components was determined using logistic regression analysis.
SEMI	NEG	PMC5371466.xml	S110	Results	NEG	There was no evidence of an additive interaction between obesity and elevated UA for the risk of elevated FPG and low HDL-C, and elevated BP in women (RERI ≈ 0 and AP ≈ 0).
SEMI	NEG	PMC5371466.xml	S114	Discussion	NEG	The magnitude of the effect of modification was large; obese men and women with elevated UA had 15.49 and 16.25 times the risk of having NAFLD, and 5.05 and 5.25 times the risk for hypertriglyceridemia, which were much higher than the increased risks among obese individuals with normal UA levels or nonobese persons with elevated UA levels.
SEMI	NEG	PMC5371466.xml	S128	Discussion	NEG	Taken together, these findings suggest that obesity may be an essential confounder in the relation between UA and metabolic disorders, although some may disagree.

SEMI	NEG	PMC5371468.xml	S57	Materials and methods	NEG	The evaluation of staining was referred to a previous report with some modifications, as follows: immunostaining was classified based on staining intensity and percentage of positive tumor cells.
SEMI	NEG	PMC5371469.xml	S6	Abstract	NEG	The radiological grading system's inter- and intraobserver reliability was assessed through serial evaluations by 2 blinded reviewers.
SEMI	NEG	PMC5371469.xml	S52	Results	NEG	There were also no differences in immediate postoperative complications.
SEMI	NEG	PMC5371469.xml	S75	Discussion	NEG	The bilateral cases, with a good sample in Fig. 3—offering a representative example of different grades in a bilateral disease—also supports our idea of gradual hip destruction in RPOH.
SEMI	NEG	PMC5371469.xml	S89	Discussion	NEG	The observed severe degenerative changes were similar to those described in the literature.[9,13,15]
SEMI	NEG	PMC5371471.xml	S20	Introduction	NEG	This phenomenon is well known as the Warburg effect.
SEMI	NEG	PMC5371471.xml	S37	Methods	NEG	In the end, 80 patients were eligible for inclusion.
SEMI	NEG	PMC5371471.xml	S56	Methods	NEG	In order to simplify the problem, we assumed that the effect of LDH and the baseline hazard were constant during the whole survival period.
SEMI	NEG	PMC5371471.xml	S81	Results	NEG	After adjusting for age and resection modality, the multiple failure-time Cox model disclosed a discernible dose–response association: along with the increase of LDH value, the hazard of death was also increasing: compared with LDH≤155 U/L, the HRs for 155 U/L < LDH < 196 U/L and LDH≥196 U/L were 2.07 (95% CI: 0.88–4.88) and 3.15 (95% CI: 1.30–7.59), respectively (Fig. 2).
SEMI	NEG	PMC5371471.xml	S89	Discussion	NEG	Moreover, LDH has been found directly promoted the growth of PC cells in vitro.[21]
SEMI	POS	PMC5371471.xml	S93	Discussion	POS	Nevertheless, our study does have several limitations.
SEMI	POS	PMC5371471.xml	S94	Discussion	POS	At first, we lack the data of some clinical characteristics of PC, such as tumor stage, size, location, and lymph node implication.
SEMI	POS	PMC5371471.xml	S95	Discussion	POS	It is highly likely that these unadjusted factors can bring confounding to our study results.
SEMI	POS	PMC5371471.xml	S96	Discussion	POS	Second, selection bias cannot be precluded, as we only analyzed PC patients whose vital information was complete.
SEMI	POS	PMC5371471.xml	S97	Discussion	POS	Besides, the sample size of patients was comparatively small, which impeded more thorough analysis of data, and to some extent, it may influence the accuracy of estimation.
SEMI	POS	PMC5371471.xml	S98	Discussion	POS	Finally, compared with OS, the association between postresection LDH and disease-free survival of PC undoubtedly bears a much more prominent clinical significance.
SEMI	POS	PMC5371471.xml	S99	Discussion	POS	However, because of data limitation, we can only expect to discuss this issue in future studies.
SEMI	NEG	PMC5371471.xml	S100	Discussion	NEG	Despite aforementioned limitations, our study is the very first to analyze the prognostic significance of varying postresection LDH in early stage PC patients, and the credibility of results can be substantially consolidated by properly applied dynamic survival analysis method.
SEMI	NEG	PMC5371471.xml	S105	Discussion	NEG	To conclude, in the current study, we found that postresection LDH was significantly associated with OS in a group of early stage PC patients.
SEMI	NEG	PMC5371472.xml	S25	Introduction	NEG	The clinical and pathological characteristics of isolate IgG4-SC had been described[7]; however, rare investigations investigated the differences of clinical characteristics of IgG4-SC between with and without other organ affected.
SEMI	NEG	PMC5371472.xml	S80	Results	NEG	The ratio of type 1 cholangiographic classification in the single lesion group was higher, whereas more type 2 and type 3 patients existed in the double lesion group or multiple lesions group (Table 1).
SEMI	NEG	PMC5371472.xml	S94	Discussion	NEG	IgG4-RD is an increasingly recognized immune-mediated condition, and it could involve nearly every anatomic site.
SEMI	NEG	PMC5371472.xml	S104	Discussion	NEG	It is reasonable because when more organs were affected, a spectrum of mild localized symptoms to organ damage might occur.[13]
SEMI	NEG	PMC5371474.xml	S10	Abstract	NEG	Eculizumab allowed the resolution of fever and inflammation, and prevented further thromboembolism.
SEMI	NEG	PMC5371474.xml	S105	Discussion	NEG	Eculizumab blocks terminal complement pathway, which appears to be 1 of the key factors of thrombosis in PNH.
SEMI	NEG	PMC5371474.xml	S108	Discussion	NEG	Successful discontinuation of anticoagulation in patients with previous thrombosis receiving eculizumab has been reported.[20]
SEMI	NEG	PMC5371474.xml	S110	Discussion	NEG	In our case, both vitamin K antagonists and antiplatelet treatment were initially maintained, but anticoagulation was stopped when the patient developed a myelodysplastic syndrome with severe thrombocytopenia.
SEMI	NEG	PMC5371475.xml	S24		NEG	Our aim was to construct and validate a simple, accurate, and widely applicable nomogram offering an early estimate of the risk of in-hospital mortality, using objective data, immediately available upon presentation to the ED, derived from a population of subjects following acute poisoning with drugs and nonpharmaceutical agents, irrespective of the dose, route of exposure, or mechanism of toxicity.
SEMI	NEG	PMC5371475.xml	S40		NEG	The setting for this study was an urban tertiary center with over 85,000 ED visits annually.
SEMI	NEG	PMC5371475.xml	S152		NEG	In the present study, we developed a predictive model incorporating demographic, ECG and echocardiography parameters, as well as laboratory data, from a cohort of patients with acute poisoning with different toxins, to determine the mortality risk on admission to the ED.
SEMI	NEG	PMC5371475.xml	S195		NEG	Novel biomarkers, larger data sets, improved data collection methods, and more sophisticated modeling procedures are needed to improve predictive accuracy.
SEMI	NEG	PMC5371478.xml	S15	Abstract	NEG	Compared the mild L1 gene methylation, the OR of moderate L1 gene methylation were 3.313 (CI: 1.002–10.952) and 5.075 (CI: 1.385–18.603) in Han and Uygur women, the OR of severe L1 gene methylation were 20.592 (CI: 3.691–114.880) and 63.634 (CI: 10.400–389.368) in Han and Uygur women.
SEMI	NEG	PMC5371478.xml	S79	Methods	NEG	The detailed steps of MS-HRM PCR referred to the handbook of EpiTect HRM PCR.5
SEMI	NEG	PMC5371478.xml	S96	Results	NEG	Then, the differences of infection status between 2 ethnics were compared.
SEMI	NEG	PMC5371478.xml	S111	Results	NEG	Because DI and SPF had statistic difference between Han and Uygur women in the same HPV-16 infection status, so respectively compared the DI and SPF in different L1 gene methylation grades to prove that L1 gene methylation effected the DNA ploidy of host cells.
SEMI	NEG	PMC5371479.xml	S19	Abstract	NEG	The combined application of 3D printing and computer NAV may be useful for tumor targeting and safe osteotomies in pelvic tumor surgery.
SEMI	NEG	PMC5371479.xml	S23	Introduction	NEG	Resection of the tumor is suggested if the tumor increases in size and progresses toward malignancy.
SEMI	NEG	PMC5371479.xml	S84	Discussion	NEG	Here, we describe the combined use of 3D printing and a computer NAV system to enable the en bloc resection of a complex pelvic osteochondroma progressing toward malignancy.
SEMI	NEG	PMC5371479.xml	S99	Discussion	NEG	This solution used with an intraoperative CT scan provides a 26-second scan time and automatic data transfer, eliminating the need for lengthy patient registration, reducing X-ray exposure for surgeons, and enabling NAV immediately after image acquisition.
SEMI	NEG	PMC5371480.xml	S56	Materials and methods	NEG	The margin was classified as circumscribed, indistinct, angular, microlobulated, or spiculated.
SEMI	NEG	PMC5371480.xml	S79	Results	NEG	The malignancy rate was higher for clustered cysts (33.3%) and irregular or noncircumscribed masses (12.7%) than for circumscribed oval masses (5%) or complicated cysts (5%) on initial US (P = 0.043).
SEMI	NEG	PMC5371480.xml	S80	Results	NEG	Of the 289 lesions initially categorized as probably benign, 230 (79.6%) were true circumscribed oval parallel masses and included 18 complicated cysts, 4 clustered cysts, and 8 intraductal lesions.
SEMI	NEG	PMC5371480.xml	S101	Results	NEG	Sixty-six lesions (22.8%) showed morphologic changes in shape, margin, echogenicity, or orientation; 64 (97%) of these lesions showed changes in both morphology and diameter, and 2 (3%) showed only a morphologic change (Fig. 2).
SEMI	NEG	PMC5371480.xml	S106	Results	NEG	In the 9 malignant lesions that showed a change in morphology, the margin showed the highest rate of change (7/9, 77.8%) followed by shape (4/9, 44.4%).
SEMI	NEG	PMC5371480.xml	S110	Results	NEG	The echogenicity and orientation remained unchanged in all 9 malignant lesions that showed an interval change.
SEMI	NEG	PMC5371480.xml	S115	Discussion	NEG	Moon et al[12] reported a 10.3% malignancy rate in 214 lesions initially categorized as probably benign lesions but showed interval growth on follow-up US examination.
SEMI	POS	PMC5371480.xml	S132	Discussion	POS	This study has some limitations.
SEMI	POS	PMC5371480.xml	S133	Discussion	POS	First, it was retrospective in nature and the malignancy rate of the lesions showing an interval change was already known.
SEMI	POS	PMC5371480.xml	S134	Discussion	POS	Therefore, a degree of observer bias was inevitable.
SEMI	POS	PMC5371480.xml	S135	Discussion	POS	Second, the status of the patients with regard to menopause and hormonal treatment could not be determined in some cases; fibroadenomas can progress, especially in premenopausal women but also in postmenopausal women on hormone replacement therapy.
SEMI	POS	PMC5371480.xml	S136	Discussion	POS	However, given that the median age was 46 years in the patients with malignant lesions and 43 years in those with benign lesions, any difference in menopause status between the 2 groups is unlikely to have been critical.
SEMI	POS	PMC5371480.xml	S137	Discussion	POS	Third, 174 (60.2%) of the benign lesions were not pathologically confirmed by US-VAE or surgical excision, and the inclusion criterion for these lesions was 12 months of follow-up after US-CNB, which is not as long as 24 months.
SEMI	POS	PMC5371480.xml	S138	Discussion	POS	Therefore, some slowly progressing cancers may have been missed in this study.
SEMI	NEG	PMC5371481.xml	S31	Case report	NEG	No palpable lesion was found in the thyroid gland and abdominal examination showed no abnormalities.
SEMI	NEG	PMC5371481.xml	S68	Discussion	NEG	In our case, the lesion was characterized by abundant calcification, which in the evaluation of TLFCK is still requested for further study.
SEMI	NEG	PMC5371481.xml	S85	Discussion	NEG	So the final pathological diagnosis was primary thyroid-like follicular carcinoma of the kidney.
SEMI	NEG	PMC5371481.xml	S95	Conclusions	NEG	Once the diagnosis has been established, the objective of surgical management is to remove the tumor and preserve renal function; all therapeutic regimens are more standardized in improving outcome.
SEMI	NEG	PMC5371482.xml	S12	Abstract	NEG	BORIS expression was associated with tumor size, differentiation grade, satellite lesions, and recurrence while SOCS3 expression correlated with differentiation grade, vascular invasion, and recurrence.
SEMI	NEG	PMC5371482.xml	S22	Introduction	NEG	Therefore, it is extremely important to identify sensitive and reliable biomarkers for the diagnosis, prognosis, and target therapy of HCC.
SEMI	NEG	PMC5371482.xml	S74	Methods	NEG	After incubation with 5% normal goat serum for 30 minutes at 37 °C to block nonspecific binding, the slides were incubated with anti-BORIS rabbit polyclonal antibody (ab126766, Abcam, Cambridge, USA, at 1:200 dilution) or anti-SOCS3 rabbit polyclonal antibody (ab16040, at 1:150 dilution) overnight at 4 °C.
SEMI	NEG	PMC5371482.xml	S182	Discussion	NEG	Notably, we observed a negative correlation between BORIS and SOCS3 in HCC, which has not been reported before.
SEMI	NEG	PMC5371484.xml	S15	Abstract	NEG	Additionally, visual acuity tended to improve over baseline in the IU group.
SEMI	NEG	PMC5371484.xml	S45	Introduction	NEG	Reduced choroidal blood flow was shown to occur in patients with RP and was suggested to play a role in photoreceptor damage.[25]
SEMI	NEG	PMC5371484.xml	S167	Discussion	NEG	Moreover, the mean logMAR BCVA improved in the IU group, but it slightly declined in the placebo group at 54 weeks.
SEMI	NEG	PMC5371484.xml	S175	Discussion	NEG	Because administration of topical IU has been shown to rescue both RPE and photoreceptor function, it may prevent macular atrophy progression and/or enlargement.[8,23,24]
SEMI	NEG	PMC5371486.xml	S5	Abstract	NEG	This is the first report of a case involving the use of posterior low lumbar segmental instrumentation with a screw–rod system.
SEMI	NEG	PMC5371486.xml	S12	Abstract	NEG	Rods used as spinal instrumentation have the possibility of protruding into the spinal canal and endangering the nervous system.
SEMI	NEG	PMC5371486.xml	S50	Discussion	NEG	Posterior laminal fusion may be dangerous, and implant failure may be caused by a lack of fusion.
SEMI	NEG	PMC5371486.xml	S75	Discussion	NEG	Plain films after the index surgery showed that the position of the screws was appropriate.
SEMI	NEG	PMC5371488.xml	S68	Results	NEG	Overall survival in period 2 was better than that in period 1 (Table 5).
SEMI	NEG	PMC5371488.xml	S96	Discussion	NEG	However, the results of any transection technique are likely affected by the experience and expertise of the handling surgeons and centers.
SEMI	NEG	PMC5371488.xml	S103	Discussion	NEG	Nevertheless, since a randomized controlled trial on the topic would be impractical, using PSM is probably the closest method.
SEMI	NEG	PMC5371488.xml	S109	Discussion	NEG	In conclusion, while there are factors which surgeons have no control of (eg, cancer stage, tumor size and number, and presence of venous invasion), every surgeon should do their best to minimize intraoperative blood loss, and meticulous perioperative care should be given to every patient to prevent postoperative complications, which can significantly affect survival.
SEMI	NEG	PMC5371489.xml	S16	Introduction	NEG	The authors hypothesized that a pregnant women present a negative impact on the quality of life related to foot health, compare with Nulliparous, which appears to be associated with the pregnancy period.
SEMI	NEG	PMC5371489.xml	S56	Methods	NEG	This research was approved by the Research and Ethics Committee of the University of A Coruña (Spain), file number CE 17/2016.
SEMI	POS	PMC5371489.xml	S86	Discussion	POS	Furthermore, the current study has some limitations.
SEMI	POS	PMC5371489.xml	S87	Discussion	POS	We did not study the degree of foot care of the participants, and because we think is a cultural aspect of the different countries, a multicentre studies are needed to find out if a higher foot care could improve the foot health during pregnant and avoid the pain that pregnant women has described in our study.
SEMI	NEG	PMC5371491.xml	S4	Abstract	NEG	Medical records were retrospectively reviewed for patients younger than 19 years who underwent radical resection or limited resection (enucleation) between 2000 and 2015.
SEMI	NEG	PMC5371491.xml	S144	Discussion	NEG	Insulinomas are the most frequent type of PNET, and have been reported in children as young as 5 years.[29,30]
SEMI	NEG	PMC5371491.xml	S146	Discussion	NEG	By contrast, none of our patients showed preoperative metastasis, even though 10% to 20% of PNET patients may present with metastasis.[31]
SEMI	NEG	PMC5371491.xml	S154	Discussion	NEG	Two patients in our series (patients 3 and 10) suffered malignant pancreatic tumors, which are rare in adolescents: overall incidence among patients 19 years or younger is 0.18 per million in the United States.[15]
SEMI	NEG	PMC5371492.xml	S54	Materials	NEG	Specific activity of 18F-FC119S was >1200 Ci/mmol and the average radiochemical purity was 99%.
SEMI	NEG	PMC5371492.xml	S74	Materials	NEG	Partial volume correction was not applied to avoid overestimation of cerebral cortical uptake due to the proximity of white matter.
SEMI	NEG	PMC5371492.xml	S78	Materials	NEG	Vital signs and clinical symptoms were evaluated before and after PET imaging.
SEMI	NEG	PMC5371492.xml	S99	Materials	NEG	Normal distributions for all continuous variables were evaluated using Shapiro-Wilk test.
SEMI	NEG	PMC5371492.xml	S131	Results	NEG	One of these 7 patients had a negative scan on 18F-FC119S PET.
SEMI	NEG	PMC5371492.xml	S133	Results	NEG	Overall, 47 of 48 participants (98%) showed identical results based on visual analysis of both PET images.
SEMI	NEG	PMC5371492.xml	S142	Results	NEG	On the contrary, 18F-FC119S PET yielded a slightly lower effect size than 11C-PiB PET in MCI patients (d = 1.26 and 1.38 for 18F-FC119S and 11C-PiB, respectively).
SEMI	NEG	PMC5371492.xml	S171	Discussion	NEG	Contrary to cortical uptake, the nonspecific binding of 18F-FC119S to white matter (with the frontal cortex-to-white matter SUV ratio of 0.76) was slightly lower than that of 11C-PiB (ratio of 0.73) or other 18F-labeled amyloid radiotracers (with reported ratios ranging from 0.66 to 0.72)[24,28,29] in HC subjects.
SEMI	POS	PMC5371492.xml	S189	Discussion	POS	The present study has several limitations.
SEMI	POS	PMC5371492.xml	S190	Discussion	POS	First, AD and MCI patients were diagnosed with clinical criteria only.
SEMI	POS	PMC5371492.xml	S192	Discussion	POS	Second, the mean age of HC subjects (49 years) was significantly smaller than that of AD (74 years) or MCI patients (72 years).
SEMI	POS	PMC5371492.xml	S193	Discussion	POS	In visual analysis, none of the 28 HC subjects showed positive scan in this study.
SEMI	POS	PMC5371492.xml	S194	Discussion	POS	This was different from previous report showing that 18% and 10% of healthy controls showed positive scans on 11C-PiB PET[33] and 18F-florbetaben PET,[15] respectively.
SEMI	POS	PMC5371492.xml	S195	Discussion	POS	It has been also reported that 20% to 34% of healthy elderly aged over 75 years have Aβ neuropathology.[34]
SEMI	POS	PMC5371492.xml	S196	Discussion	POS	As all of our HC subjects were under the age of 62 years in the current study, future 18F-FC119S PET studies with healthy elderly aged over 75 years might be needed.
SEMI	POS	PMC5371492.xml	S197	Discussion	POS	Finally, since this study was performed with a relatively small number of subjects in a single institution, a multi-institutional study involving a larger number of subjects is required to verify the results of this study.
SEMI	NEG	PMC5371494.xml	S45		NEG	Information regarding the acuity of a VTE event (deep vein thrombosis—DVT and/or pulmonary embolism—PE) and anticoagulation use was collected.
SEMI	NEG	PMC5371494.xml	S104		NEG	The in-hospital mortality for patients requiring IVCFs was high at 8.7%.
SEMI	NEG	PMC5371494.xml	S177		NEG	IVCF retrieval rates have traditionally been below 50%, even in large academic centers.
SEMI	NEG	PMC5371494.xml	S187		NEG	Once the risk of bleeding is assessed to be low, such that conventional anticoagulation can be started, the general recommendation is that the filter be removed.[3]
SEMI	NEG	PMC5371495.xml	S32	Case presentation	NEG	Serum hepatitis B surface antigen (HBsAg), e antibody (HBeAb), and core antibody (HBcAb) tests were positive, whereas serum hepatitis C antibody (HCVAb) was negative.
SEMI	NEG	PMC5371495.xml	S42	Case presentation	NEG	Intraoperative frozen histopathological examination indicated that the tumor in liver was HCC, but the reoperitoneal mass was of unclear origin and pancreatic endocrine tumor could not be excluded.
SEMI	NEG	PMC5371495.xml	S50	Case presentation	NEG	Since TACE is safe and effective therapy for intrahepatic multiple tumors in advanced stage.
SEMI	NEG	PMC5371495.xml	S65	Discussion	NEG	The overall prognosis of PCCCL is still unclear as there are some reports suggesting that the outcome of patients with PCCCL is better than those with other types of HCC[7] and there are other data indicating that the prognosis of these patients is similar to its common type counterparts and may be even worse.[8,9]
SEMI	NEG	PMC5371496.xml	S14	Abstract	NEG	Non-intubated thoracoscopic pulmonary wedge resection is feasible for patients with compromised lung function, meanwhile, preoperative coil labeling of small nodules is reliable.
SEMI	NEG	PMC5371496.xml	S25	Introduction	NEG	In our institute, localization of small nodules by CT-guided hookwire insertion before surgery is replaced by coil labeling, because the hookwire is not reliable for all cases.
SEMI	NEG	PMC5371496.xml	S69	Case presentation	NEG	The recovery of this patient was mainly uneventful, and he discharged 5 days after the operation.
SEMI	NEG	PMC5371496.xml	S75	Discussion	NEG	There are several issues concerning this dilemma need to be elucidated.
