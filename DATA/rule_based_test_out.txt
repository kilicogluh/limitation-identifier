TN|PMC5120911_S121|NEG|NEG|Other symptoms, such as muscular chest pain, odynophagia, sense of obstruction when swallowing had no significant correlation to levels of anxiety and depression and health-related QoL (Table 5).
TN|PMC5120911_S157|NEG|NEG|Physical symptoms, such as chest pain, heartburn, acid regurgitation, and dysphagia, were closely related to the psychologic state in patients with NCCP as we shown.
TN|PMC5120911_S165|NEG|NEG|This study also had several limitations.
TP|PMC5120911_S166|POS|POS|First, although the path model suggested that physical symptoms could act on psychological states, through which indirectly influence on the QoL, the prospective studies are still required to examine and confirm the cause–effect relationships among each other.
TP|PMC5120911_S167|POS|POS|Second, although the HADS and SF-36 questionnaire were widely used in clinics for assessment of anxiety/depression and health-related QoL, it need further evaluating the applicability of translated version of these self-reported questionnaires on Chinese NCCP subjects.
TP|PMC5120911_S168|POS|POS|Third, we did not follow-up with our NCCP patients, thus, it should be our subsequent works to follow-up the patients and verify our conclusions.
TN|PMC5120911_S23|NEG|NEG|Psychiatric symptoms may cause the chest pain alone, or along with the organic disorders, which may be the reason why the pain is difficult to cure or usually recurrent.
TN|PMC5120911_S60|NEG|NEG|The Hospital Anxiety and Depression Scale (HADS) is widely used scale for detecting depression and anxiety in the clinic setting, which comprises of 14 items with a scale of 0 to 3 for each items.
TN|PMC5120912_S10|NEG|NEG|Patients with low KISS1 mRNA expression had shorter survival time than those with high expression (P = 0.001).
TN|PMC5120912_S18|NEG|NEG|Kisspeptin (KISS1) gene was originally identified in melanoma by Lee et al[7] in experiments designed to identify the molecules responsible for the antimetastatic effect of human chromosome 6.
TN|PMC5120912_S19|NEG|NEG|Previous researches focusing on solid tumors, such as brain, breast, bladder, gastric, and pancreatic cancers, have demonstrated the correlations between reduce level of KISS1 mRNA and increased tumor progression as well as poor prognosis.[8–13]
TN|PMC5120912_S20|NEG|NEG|However, the KISS1 expression and its clinical/prognostic relevance in epithelial ovarian cancer still remained not fully investigated.
TN|PMC5120913_S201|NEG|NEG|Intriguingly, the HLA-DQA1 SNPs are in close proximity (<100 bp) of an androgen receptor binding site.
TN|PMC5120913_S42|NEG|NEG|In the present GWAS, we explored the genetic basis of sex differences by comparing genotype frequencies between male and female cases with childhood ALL using a case-only study design.
TN|PMC5120913_S59|NEG|NEG|Established childhood ALL risk associations identified in previous GWAS[14–16] have been replicated to validate the parent case-control study sample using TaqMan allelic discrimination assays at FIU.[11]

TN|PMC5120916_S36|NEG|NEG|The enrollment criteria for these patients were as follows: No spinal fractures, or scoliosis history; no history of spinal surgery; diagnosis of consecutive spondylolisthesis on a lateral lumbar spine X-ray.
TN|PMC5120916_S80|NEG|NEG|It is worth noting that the antishearing force mechanisms are compromised in lumbar spondylolisthesis.[19–21]
TN|PMC5120916_S91|NEG|NEG|Although our results clearly demonstrated that consecutive spondylolisthesis resulted in a modification of pelvic parameters, our data indicated that the values of SS (37.2°) and PT (31.6°) in patients with consecutive spondylolisthesis were higher than those observed in the healthy population (PT = 25.1° and SS = 30.7°)[29–31] in the same age group.
TN|PMC5120916_S92|NEG|NEG|In the present study, all the Taillard indexes were below 50%, classifying the grade of spondylolisthesis as I or II.
TN|PMC5120917_S176|NEG|NEG|However, this analysis has several limitations.
TP|PMC5120917_S177|POS|POS|Despite careful control to minimize the confounding effects, we cannot rule out the possibility that misclassification of outcome affected our results, and the cross-sectional nature of the study prevented our confirming the causal effect of MetS in the pathogenesis of UL.
TP|PMC5120917_S178|POS|POS|Finally, because only Korean women were recruited, our findings cannot be generalized to other ethnicities or geographic regions.
FP|PMC5120917_S179|POS|NEG|In conclusion, the present study shows that women with UL are at greater risk of prevalence of MetS regardless of confounding factors.
FP|PMC5120917_S180|POS|NEG|We suggest the biological mechanism responsible for UL may involve IR aggravation, which is atherosclerotic pathway as nonhormonal factor.
FP|PMC5120917_S181|POS|NEG|In our view, the clinical relevance of a relation between UL and IR is that the early detection and management of metabolic abnormality be considered in women presenting with UL.
TP|PMC5120917_S182|POS|POS|Further prospective research is required to prove causality and to determine the role played by metabolic abnormalities in the natural history of UL.
TN|PMC5120917_S185|NEG|NEG|Our study found that MetS and each of their components was associated with an increased prevalence of UL when age and reproductive variables were adjusted among the parous premenopausal women without symptom.
TN|PMC5120917_S187|NEG|NEG|These findings have clinically important implications for designing UL prevention or management strategies.
TN|PMC5120917_S19|NEG|NEG|The mass effect of UL is the main cause of hysterectomy, because it causes pressure upon adjacent organs, excessive uterine bleeding, or problems related to pregnancy, including infertility and repetitive pregnancy loss.[3]
TN|PMC5120917_S3|NEG|NEG|Previous studies have reported that uterine leiomyoma (UL) may share pathogenic features with obesity and hypertension, which are components of metabolic syndrome (MetS).
TN|PMC5120917_S38|NEG|NEG|The 1230 study subjects were recruited among premenopausal women checked for UL at a health promotion center at Pusan National University Hospital between March 2012 and February 2014.
TN|PMC5120917_S61|NEG|NEG|IR was determined by homeostasis model assessment (HOMA-IR). 
TN|PMC5120917_S72|NEG|NEG|If there were ≥2 UL lesions, the size of the largest UL lesion was recorded.
TN|PMC5120918_S117|NEG|NEG|This study also has some limitations.
TP|PMC5120918_S118|POS|POS|We did not further grouped patients based on their underlying comorbidities.
FP|PMC5120918_S119|POS|NEG|Detailed stratification on the presence of respective comorbidities could yield further results.
TP|PMC5120918_S120|POS|POS|Secondly, we did not have a control cohort of comparable patients without Buerger exercise.
TP|PMC5120918_S121|POS|POS|Also, regular follow-up and exact completion of Buerger exercise at home could be limited due to its community-based nature.
TP|PMC5120918_S122|POS|POS|Further randomized cohort studies are required to identify the maximal effects or the “cut-point” for establishing treatment recommendation when doing Buerger exercise.
TN|PMC5120918_S127|NEG|NEG|Significant increased SPP values in either wounded or unwounded diabetes feet immediately after Buerger exercise were observed, which indicated that Buerger exercise can improve foot peripheral circulation in subgroups of our study.
TN|PMC5120918_S20|NEG|NEG|Foot problems are common in diabetic patients, 15% to 25% of whom develop diabetes foot ulcers (DFU) in their lifetime.[1]
TN|PMC5120918_S3|NEG|NEG|Buerger exercise can improve the peripheral circulation of lower extremities.
TN|PMC5120918_S70|NEG|NEG|The correlation between pre-exercise SPP and improvement of SPP after exercise was analyzed using Spearman rank correlation.
TN|PMC5120918_S76|NEG|NEG|We measured and collected SPP data of 46 feet, including 34 wounded feet and 12 unwounded feet.
TN|PMC5120918_S9|NEG|NEG|Their mean duration of diabetes was 13.6 ± 8.2 years.
TN|PMC5120919_S168|NEG|NEG|During the thermal injury, pain assessments (NRS) were made at 0, 30, 60, 120, 180, 240, 300, 360, and 420 seconds.
TN|PMC5120919_S234|NEG|NEG|These signs and symptoms subside in most cases 24 to 48 hours after the injury, without leaving residual signs.
TN|PMC5120919_S280|NEG|NEG|If so, then this enriched design may be used in future clinical and basic science research to elucidate markers of vulnerability to chronic postsurgical pain.[14]
TN|PMC5120919_S7|NEG|NEG|Healthy participants (n = 80) underwent a screening day (day 0) with induction of a thermal skin injury (47°C, 420 seconds, 12.5 cm2).
TN|PMC5120920_S27|NEG|NEG|These infections require long and expensive treatment regimens and are associated with severe adverse events and very low cure rates.[2]
TN|PMC5120920_S31|NEG|NEG|Delamanid is a nitro-dihydro-imidazoxazole derivative with mycobacteria-specific antibacterial activity in vitro, without activity against Gram-positive or Gram-negative bacteria or intestinal flora.[8]
TN|PMC5120920_S54|NEG|NEG|Based on early detection of rifampicin resistance by Xpert MTB/RIF (Cepheid, Sunnyvale, CA), initially (October 4, 2013) the child was treated with high-dose isoniazid, ethambutol, pyrazinamide, and moxifloxacin.
TN|PMC5120920_S74|NEG|NEG|Meropenem and amoxicillin-clavulanate were then discontinued before the discharge from the hospital, and the patient continued the other 5 drugs, including delamanid.
TN|PMC5120921_S157|NEG|NEG|Other factors such as smoking cessation, physical inactivity, hypertension, and avoidance of dust and environmental exposures are also likely to mitigate the incident risk of prediabetes and diabetes.
TN|PMC5120921_S158|NEG|NEG|Our study has several limitations.
TP|PMC5120921_S159|POS|POS|All participants were from the Kailuan community.
TN|PMC5120921_S160|NEG|NEG|However, our findings are likely generalizable because similar incident rates were reported in recent Chinese studies.[15,17]
TP|PMC5120921_S161|POS|POS|Further, we did not collect information on random plasma glucose level and oral glucose tolerance test results, and we may underestimate the prevalence/incidence rates.
TN|PMC5120921_S38|NEG|NEG|Our present study includes data and longitudinal follow-up of these participants over 4 years (2006–2010), where surveys were conducted every 2 years (2006, 2008, and 2010).
TN|PMC5120921_S63|NEG|NEG|We measured hip circumference at the level of the maximal protrusion of the gluteal muscles (hips).
TN|PMC5120921_S65|NEG|NEG|Waist-to-hip ratio (WHR) was calculated as WC (cm)/hip (cm).
TN|PMC5120922_S34|NEG|NEG|To prevent skin irritation, I-shaped elastic tape was applied without any stretch at the ends of the tape (approximately 2–3 cm).[6]
TN|PMC5120922_S35|NEG|NEG|The balance taping was removed within 24 hours and reapplied every day, regardless of the presence or absence of skin itching.[6,7]
TN|PMC5120922_S4|NEG|NEG|Hallux valgus, an increased angle of lateral deviation in the big toe, can cause pain and difficulties in balancing and walking.
TN|PMC5120922_S45|NEG|NEG|However, while the HVA recovered to a normal angle, the IMA did not.
FP|PMC5120923_S140|POS|NEG|It is notable that our study examined whether occupational distress was correlated with NAFLD in a police population after adjusting for baseline demographic and socioeconomic variables, which could have clinical and therapeutic implications as well as provide further information to investigators about the underlying mechanisms.
TN|PMC5120923_S141|NEG|NEG|However, there are several limitations of our research.
FN|PMC5120923_S142|NEG|POS|First, the scale that was used in our study might be a crude measure, although has been validated for evaluating occupational stress.[10]
TP|PMC5120923_S143|POS|POS|Additionally, we recorded OSI-R scores via questionnaires at baseline only, with no reassessments during the follow-up years.
TN|PMC5120923_S144|NEG|NEG|Second, considering the large sample size of our study, we utilized blood tests (based on ALT) and ultrasonography as screening tools, which were relatively sensitive, low cost, and widely available to all subjects.[61]
FN|PMC5120923_S145|NEG|POS|However, the sensitivity was lower than that of liver biopsy, which is the “gold standard” for diagnosis of NAFLD.[61]
TN|PMC5120923_S146|NEG|NEG|Third, NAFLD had appeared to be associated with air pollution and traffic noise.[62]
FN|PMC5120923_S147|NEG|POS|However, we did not obtain comprehensive nutrition and environmental monitoring data, regarding the nutritional status, air pollution status, and traffic noise levels, encountered by police officers.
TP|PMC5120923_S148|POS|POS|Thus, it is difficult to confirm the precise influence of nutrition and environmental factors on NAFLD and occupational stress.
TP|PMC5120923_S149|POS|POS|Lastly, the number of female police officers in our study is relatively small (n = 501) versus male officers (n = 6559) and the incidence of NAFLD in policewomen is also relatively low (5.6%), so we just analyzed and compared male data in the end.
TP|PMC5120923_S150|POS|POS|Thus, we could not provide valuable conclusions about the female police population.
FP|PMC5120923_S151|POS|NEG|In view of these limitations, more clinical and epidemiological studies are required to enrich and confirm our findings.
FP|PMC5120923_S152|POS|NEG|In summary, this cohort study reveal that HOS and HPS are independent predictors of NAFLD in a Chinese police population, especially among traffic control police.
TP|PMC5120923_S153|POS|POS|Systematic investigations using more accurate and noninvasive imaging techniques are warranted to confirm our conclusions and to contribute to the development of more suitable treatments and psychological interventions for NAFLD and occupational stress, consequently elucidating the need for regular screening, healthy lifestyle modifications, and stress monitoring among occupational populations.
TN|PMC5120923_S17|NEG|NEG|The prevalence of NAFLD, in the Chinese general population, is reported to be 20% (6.3–27.0%), which is increasing with a rapid increase in obesity and other metabolic syndromes (MetS).[2–4]
TN|PMC5120923_S33|NEG|NEG|Among them, 4192 participants were excluded based on the following criteria: 408 did not complete the OSI-R and self-designed questionnaires at baseline; 295 had missing ultrasound scanning data; 981 had a history of or concurrent alcohol abuse (more than 30 g/d for males)[12]; 362 were using steatohepatitis medication; 2146 had been diagnosed with NAFLD, chronic hepatitis B or C, autoimmune hepatitis or other liver diseases at the beginning of the study.
TN|PMC5120923_S34|NEG|NEG|Ultimately, the other 2367 subjects agreed to be followed up with dynamic observations each year from 2008 to 2011 (see Fig. 1 for a subject flowchart).
TN|PMC5120923_S49|NEG|NEG|Then, we divided our sample into 4 groups according to T scores: low stress and strain (≤40; LOS/LPS), normal stress and strain (40–59; NOS/NPS), moderate stress and strain (60–69; MOS/MPS), and high stress and strain (≥70; HOS/HPS) for ORQ and PSQ; and significant deficits in coping resources (<30; SDCR), moderate lack of coping resources (30–39; MLCR), average coping resources (40–59), and high coping resources (≥60; HCR) for PRQ.[13]
TN|PMC5120923_S50|NEG|NEG|In particular, the OSI-R questionnaire used in the present study was confirmed to have good reliability and internal consistency for Chinese policemen (Cronbach alpha: OSI-R = 0.883, ORQ = 0.908, PSQ = 0.934, and PRQ = 0.909).[11]
TN|PMC5120923_S53|NEG|NEG|The standard criteria for the diagnosis of NAFLD were based on the ordinance issued by the Fatty Liver Disease Study Group of the Chinese Liver Disease Association[14]: exclusion of other liver diseases, such as alcohol or drug-induced liver diseases, autoimmune or viral hepatitis, metabolic liver disease, and genetic liver disease[1]; laboratory tests: elevated ALT (>29 IU/L)[15]; and abdominal ultrasonic examinations: increased hepatic echogenicity compared with the spleen and kidneys, blurring of liver vasculature, and deep attenuation of ultrasonographic signals through the right hepatic lobe.
TN|PMC5120923_S56|NEG|NEG|Thorough socioeconomic and demographic variables were collected based on interviewer-administered questionnaires.
TN|PMC5120923_S59|NEG|NEG|MetS was diagnosed using the New International Diabetes Federation worldwide definition.[17]
TN|PMC5120923_S63|NEG|NEG|Mann–Whitney U test was conducted for continuous variables, and a Chi-squared test for categorical variables, which were reported as means ± standard deviations (SD) or frequencies, to compare the differences between subjects with and without NAFLD.
TN|PMC5120923_S64|NEG|NEG|Univariate Cox-proportional hazards regression analysis was performed to identify risk factors related to NAFLD.
TN|PMC5120923_S66|NEG|NEG|Meanwhile, Kaplan–Meier survival curve and the log-rank test were conducted to compare cumulative survival rate on different police assignments.
TN|PMC5120923_S8|NEG|NEG|Occupational stress was evaluated by Occupational Stress Inventory-Revised scores.
TN|PMC5120923_S82|NEG|NEG|The results of the Cox-proportional hazards regression also indicated that, before and after adjusting for traditional risk factors, MOS, HOS, and HPS were risk factors for NAFLD (MOS: hazard ratio [HR] = 1.237, 95% confidence interval [CI] = 1.049–1.460; HOS: HR = 1.727, 95% CI = 1.405–2.124; HPS: HR = 3.602, 95% CI = 1.912–6.787).
TN|PMC5120923_S83|NEG|NEG|In addition, LOS and LPS were protective factors against NAFLD (LOS: HR = 0.366, 95% CI = 0.173–0.776; LPS: HR = 0.490, 95% CI = 0.262–0.919) (Table 3).
TN|PMC5120924_S114|NEG|NEG|Among the 269 MCD patients, follow-up records were available for 208 cases (77 in the AKI group and 161 in the non-AKI group), with a follow-up rate of 77%.
TN|PMC5120924_S133|NEG|NEG|Extensive cross-linking existed between the coagulation system and the immune and inflammatory system.[25]
TN|PMC5120924_S139|NEG|NEG|This study explored for the first time the coagulation and VTE of NS-AKI patients with the MCD pathological type.
TN|PMC5120924_S140|NEG|NEG|The study had some limitations.
TP|PMC5120924_S141|POS|POS|(1) Because this study was a retrospective study, the routine tests for many blood coagulation-related indicators (i.e., vascular endothelium, platelet function, coagulation factor levels, and anticoagulation system) and the imaging studies for thrombosis were not available, resulting in shortcomings in elucidating the entire coagulation process of MCD-AKI patients.
TP|PMC5120924_S142|POS|POS|Thus, the incidence of VTE might be underestimated.
FP|PMC5120924_S143|POS|NEG|Further prospective research was still required to investigate the whole hemostatic changes in MCD-AKI.
TP|PMC5120924_S144|POS|POS|(2) Although the PSM method was used to balance the major confounding variables, many unknown confounding variables might still affect the final results.
TN|PMC5120924_S145|NEG|NEG|This study suggested that MCD-NS patients with AKI had a more severe hypercoagulable state, which might be related to the active immune inflammation of AKI that mediates activation of the coagulation system.
TN|PMC5120924_S38|NEG|NEG|All renal-biopsy-patients had signed the research protocol of Renal Clinical Database Establishment when hospitalized, allowing their data for clinical research and the research was approved by the ethics committee of the General Hospital of the Chinese People's Liberation Army.
TN|PMC5120925_S131|NEG|NEG|Liu and Zhou[32] found that the impairment of CVR rather than severe stenosis was associated with a higher risk of stroke, as the odds ratio in the first case was 1.70.
TN|PMC5120925_S133|NEG|NEG|The results of a previous study demonstrated that embolism formation is positively correlated to the stability of the plaque rather than to the degree of stenosis.[33]
TN|PMC5120925_S136|NEG|NEG|We found that patients with severe artery stenosis can maintain CBF at a certain level.
TN|PMC5120925_S141|NEG|NEG|Our study has several limitations.
TP|PMC5120925_S142|POS|POS|First, the sample size was relatively small.
TP|PMC5120925_S143|POS|POS|Further study including a larger sample on patients with different degrees of artery stenosis is therefore needed.
TP|PMC5120925_S144|POS|POS|Second, although all images were performed on a 1.5-T MR clinical system, more advanced equipment has been used in other studies.
TP|PMC5120925_S145|POS|POS|Therefore, it is possible that the diagnostic accuracy of QMR will be higher using more advanced scanners.
FP|PMC5120925_S146|POS|NEG|Finally, DSA is considered when moderate to severe vascular disease is diagnosed or when selection of interventional surgery is being considered.
TP|PMC5120925_S147|POS|POS|The subjects included in our study had relatively severe lesions, which rendered us unable to assess mild stenosis accurately.
TN|PMC5120925_S28|NEG|NEG|Furthermore, as an important parameter of cerebrovascular reserve (CVR), CBF can be estimated by perfusion-weighted imaging (PWI) MRI.[13]
TN|PMC5120925_S33|NEG|NEG|In our platform, these quantitative measures of CBF[23] and the degree of artery stenosis[12] can be generated conveniently using a high-spatial resolution MRI.
TN|PMC5120925_S52|NEG|NEG|All patients underwent routine MR stroke protocol, which included diffusion-weighted imaging (DWI), fluid-attenuated inversion recovery (FLAIR) sequences, PWI, CE-MRA, and DSC perfusion imaging.
TN|PMC5120925_S88|NEG|NEG|In 4 cases of congenital vertebral artery slim, QMR reported moderate to severe stenosis.
TN|PMC5120927_S100|NEG|NEG|Data were marked by high standard deviations and a threshold benefit for patients of 59.6% (±20.6 SD).
TN|PMC5120927_S15|NEG|NEG|Both utilities and threshold benefits were mostly independent from patient characteristics like gender, income, and social situation.
TN|PMC5120927_S158|NEG|NEG|The study shows some limitations.
TP|PMC5120927_S159|POS|POS|We did an investigation on a patient population experienced with low-risk melanoma.
FP|PMC5120927_S160|POS|NEG|The patient selection was performed for ethical reasons and in accordance with Kilbridge who also emphasized the advantages and disadvantages of this selection.
TP|PMC5120927_S161|POS|POS|Thus, the patients’ opinions are used as surrogates for patients in later disease stages.
TP|PMC5120927_S162|POS|POS|Furthermore, utilities of melanoma patients may change in the course of therapy, so our results do not evaluate this change over time.
TN|PMC5120927_S59|NEG|NEG|We asked for their personal minimum acceptable chance to stay melanoma-free 5 years after treatment in the case of mild-to moderate or severe side effects.
TN|PMC5120927_S6|NEG|NEG|Current therapeutic strategies like immune checkpoint blockade or targeted therapy may also be useful in the adjuvant setting.
TN|PMC5120927_S92|NEG|NEG|A utility of 1.0 was observed in 35 patients (26.9%).
TN|PMC5120928_S37|NEG|NEG|On admission, the patient's temperature was normal.
TN|PMC5120928_S4|NEG|NEG|Chronic lymphocytic inflammation with pontine perivascular enhancement responsive to steroids (CLIPPERS) is an inflammatory disorder in the central nervous system (CNS) with distinct clinical, radiological, and pathological features.
TN|PMC5120928_S48|NEG|NEG|Thus, the ANCA vasculitis was also excluded.[6]
TN|PMC5120928_S51|NEG|NEG|Paraneoplastic autoantibodies panels including anti-Hu, anti-CV2, anti-Ma2, anti-Ri and anti-voltage-gated K channels were negative.
TN|PMC5120929_S109|NEG|NEG|Blood-induced joint diseases and RA share similar characteristics.[5]
TN|PMC5120929_S147|NEG|NEG|According to the aforementioned indications that the elevation in sVCAM-1 levels is a multifactorial effect, hemophilia A is still a crucial factor inducing sVCAM-1 expression in the peripheral blood.
TN|PMC5120929_S149|NEG|NEG|The latter group of studies that failed to find associations between patients with RA and controls all employed a cross-sectional study design and had examined patients with chronic RA.[30]
TN|PMC5120929_S78|NEG|NEG|Linear regression was used to determine the correlation among sVCAM-1, sE-selectin, and sP-selectin.
TN|PMC5120930_S127|NEG|NEG|Many physicians in our sample used predefined HbA1C thresholds to trigger discussions about diabetes medication de-intensification, even though they were also aware of patient characteristics important for individualizing diabetes care.
TN|PMC5120930_S128|NEG|NEG|Inconsistent report of de-intensification practices in our sample may reflect variable physician awareness of existing guideline recommendations as well as a genuine clinical uncertainty over when and how to de-intensify diabetes medications.
FN|PMC5120930_S139|NEG|POS|Our finding that academic medical center physicians were more aware of the concept of individualization and de-intensification may be specific to our physician sample.
TN|PMC5120930_S159|NEG|NEG|This recommendation should be framed as a “trial” that may succeed if paired with healthy lifestyle practices.
TN|PMC5120930_S168|NEG|NEG|This study has several strengths and limitations.
FP|PMC5120930_S169|POS|NEG|This physician survey was conducted in 2 different clinical sites among physicians with different panel sizes, patient ages, and years in practice.
FP|PMC5120930_S170|POS|NEG|The response rate was very good for a physician survey overall.
FN|PMC5120930_S171|NEG|POS|However, there were fewer endocrinologists and geriatricians in our sample; larger sample sizes of endocrinologists and geriatricians would be beneficial in future studies to determine if attitudes, beliefs, and practices differ by specialty.
TP|PMC5120930_S172|POS|POS|Also, the academic medical center physicians were likely biased in their awareness of the concept of individualization and de-intensification due to the local emphasis on diabetes research.
TP|PMC5120930_S173|POS|POS|Because of the nature of the study, a cross-sectional survey of physicians, physicians’ report of knowledge, attitudes, and behaviors may not translate into actual clinical practice.
TP|PMC5120930_S174|POS|POS|As with all self-report surveys, responses are subject to social desirability bias, such that the awareness, agreement, and frequency of individualizing HbA1C goals and practice of de-intensifying medications may be over-estimated.
TP|PMC5120930_S175|POS|POS|Also, for physicians who were unfamiliar with individualization, we did not ascertain their willingness to learn about the concept; this will be an important follow-up question in future studies, as it may clarify the extent to which physicians are open to changing their practices.
TP|PMC5120930_S176|POS|POS|Finally, while this survey provides preliminary information about physician perspectives on de-intensifying diabetes medications, many more questions exist about the safety and efficacy of such practices.
TP|PMC5120930_S177|POS|POS|Further studies should examine which populations may safely discontinue diabetes medications without adverse hyperglycemic events.
TN|PMC5120930_S178|NEG|NEG|In summary, de-intensifying diabetes medications is an important concept that has only recently received attention.
TN|PMC5120930_S179|NEG|NEG|We found that primary care physicians and endocrinologists frequently individualized HbA1C goals; however, in general, decisions to de-intensify diabetes medications were driven by predefined HbA1C thresholds, rather than by individualized goals.
TN|PMC5120930_S23|NEG|NEG|More recent trials conducted in older patients with high levels cardiovascular risk found that intensive glycemic control may, at best, decrease cardiovascular events and improve surrogate microvascular endpoints, like microalbuminuria, and, at worst, lead to increased mortality.[3–6]
TN|PMC5120930_S25|NEG|NEG|This position statement was adapted into ADA diabetes care guidelines[10,11] which are consistent with those previously published by the American Geriatrics Society (AGS)[12] and Veteran Affairs/Department of Defense.[13]
TN|PMC5120930_S41|NEG|NEG|Primary care physicians at NSUHS included internal medicine, geriatrics, and family medicine physicians.
TN|PMC5120930_S43|NEG|NEG|The study was approved by the University of Chicago and NorthShore University HealthSystem Institutional Review Boards.
FP|PMC5120931_S125|POS|NEG|Therefore, a central pathology consensus of specimen was indicated in further research.
TN|PMC5120931_S133|NEG|NEG|Later, they established a predicting nomogram for EGC using the same method.[28]
TN|PMC5120931_S6|NEG|NEG|A nomogram for predicting LNM was constructed and internally validated.
TN|PMC5120931_S92|NEG|NEG|Moreover, about 39 patients will spare an unnecessary resection without missing cancers compared with the strategy that resection on all patients in theory (Fig. 4B).
TN|PMC5120932_S11|NEG|NEG|Among these noncancer decedents, 1045 (73.8%) had DNR consents, while 134 (9.5%) received hospice care.
TN|PMC5120932_S116|NEG|NEG|This study has several limitations.
TP|PMC5120932_S117|POS|POS|First, the patients were only from one tertiary hospital, which has a well-organized hospice care team, so the results would not represent the general status in medical facilities but only that in hospitals with similar levels and hospice care teams.
TP|PMC5120932_S118|POS|POS|Second, some sociodemographic characteristics such as education level, marital status, and economical status were lacking in our dataset, so we could not evaluate the association between these sociodemographic characteristics and DNR and hospice care utilization.
TP|PMC5120932_S119|POS|POS|Third, the dataset used in this study did not contain information about comorbidities, so we could not evaluate the relationship between comorbidities and DNR and hospice care utilization.
TP|PMC5120932_S120|POS|POS|Fourth, the results of this study could only be generalized to hospitals with similar level to present hospital.
TP|PMC5120932_S121|POS|POS|Furthermore, some results showed marginal statistic differences should be interpreted carefully.
FP|PMC5120932_S122|POS|NEG|Although these limitations, this is the first study to focus on DNR and hospice care utilization in non-cancer patients including brain diseases, ALS and dementia, COPD and lung diseases, heart failure, chronic liver disease and cirrhosis, and renal failure.
TN|PMC5120932_S20|NEG|NEG|Do-Not-Resuscitate (DNR) states that cardiopulmonary resuscitation will not be performed on patients in the terminal stage of incurable diseases, in order to allow them a peaceful death.[1]
TN|PMC5120932_S25|NEG|NEG|Once 2 disease-specific specialists diagnose that a patient is in a terminal stage of the disease, the physicians will discuss the patient's wishes regarding DNR with the patient or his/her family.
TN|PMC5120932_S54|NEG|NEG|For descriptive statistics, the continuous variable of age was analyzed by Student t tests and length of stay was analyzed by Mann–Whitney U test.
TN|PMC5120932_S62|NEG|NEG|Characteristics of patients who died of major noncancer diseases during 2010 to 2014 are described in Table 1.
TN|PMC5120932_S63|NEG|NEG|Between January 1, 2010 and December 31, 2014, a total of 1416 patients aged 20 years or more died of major noncancer diseases in Taipei Veterans General Hospital.
TN|PMC5120932_S9|NEG|NEG|A total of 1416 patients aged 20 years or more died of major noncancer diseases in Taipei Veterans General Hospital during the study period.
FN|PMC5120933_S138|NEG|POS|For these reasons, the incidence of AIHA may have been underestimated.
TN|PMC5120933_S77|NEG|NEG|Clinical characteristics of the AIHA cases are summarized in Table 2.
TN|PMC5120933_S87|NEG|NEG|No splenectomy was performed on these patients.
TN|PMC5120933_S91|NEG|NEG|Of these, 6 patients had major ABO incompatibility, 2 minor, and 3 major plus minor.
TN|PMC5120934_S41|NEG|NEG|Cognitive deficit further deteriorated, and rivastigmine was therefore added.
TN|PMC5120934_S77|NEG|NEG|The positions in which the rare mutations in VPS35 and FBXO7 were described are phylogenetically conserved in primates.
TN|PMC5120934_S90|NEG|NEG|It has been recently identified as a new cause of AD late-onset “sporadic” Parkinson disease with reduced penetrance.[16–18]
TN|PMC5120934_S95|NEG|NEG|In contrast to previously reported cases and families carrying VPS35 mutations, our patient had parkinsonism resembling PSP.
TN|PMC5120935_S106|NEG|NEG|In contrast, HIV-infected women experienced slower WHtR until age 40 (0.004/y vs 0.005/y, P = 0.005).
TN|PMC5120935_S129|NEG|NEG|Although published data on WHtR is very limited in adults with HIV infection, this measurement has been associated with mortality and metabolic risk in HIV-uninfected populations.[28,29]
TN|PMC5120935_S19|NEG|NEG|In FRAM, HIV-infected men and women had persistently lower subcutaneous adipose tissue over 5 years of follow-up compared to HIV-uninfected participants.[2]
TN|PMC5120935_S51|NEG|NEG|All examiners underwent a standardized training.
TN|PMC5120936_S152|NEG|NEG|Our study has a number of limitations.
TP|PMC5120936_S153|POS|POS|First, our findings are limited by the fact that we were unable to enroll our original calculated sample due to slow accrual.
TN|PMC5120936_S154|NEG|NEG|However, an increase in sample size is unlikely to change our findings as an interim review by the DSMB determined that a sample size of 65 using the same assumptions as the original calculation have a power of 70% to 90% for the standard deviation ranging from 0.3 to 0.5.
FP|PMC5120936_S155|POS|NEG|Our GDS standard deviation was 0.53 and 0.39 in the placebo and lithium arms, respectively.
TP|PMC5120936_S156|POS|POS|To the contrary, the between-group difference of GDS may be smaller than the assumed 0.25 and an even larger sample size than originally calculated may have been required to detect a significant difference.
TP|PMC5120936_S157|POS|POS|Second, 6 month trial duration could not exclude a beneficial effect of lithium on long-term functional worsening.
TP|PMC5120936_S158|POS|POS|Third, we cannot exclude selection bias as the majority of our participants were unemployed females with significant neurocognitive impairment.
TP|PMC5120936_S159|POS|POS|Fourth, all our participants were black Xhosa speaking Africans which limits the generalizability of our results.
TN|PMC5120936_S30|NEG|NEG|Effective neuroprotective adjunctive pharmacotherapy for HAND has not yet been identified.
TN|PMC5120936_S31|NEG|NEG|A number of adjunctive pharmacotherapies for HAND have been studied with disappointing results thus far.[7]
TN|PMC5120936_S34|NEG|NEG|However, these pilot studies were limited by both the lack of a comparator arm and the short duration of lithium treatment.
TN|PMC5120936_S52|NEG|NEG|Inclusion criteria were HIV-infected adults (≥18 and ≤70 years), established on ART for at least 6 months with a suppressed viral load (HIV PCR <400 copies/mL), cognitive impairment as defined by a GDS ≥ 0.5 attending public sector ART clinics in Cape Town, South Africa.
TN|PMC5120936_S78|NEG|NEG|The laboratory forwarded the concentration results only to the study statistician.
TN|PMC5120936_S80|NEG|NEG|This coinvestigator also received the adverse event logs, and in conjunction with the blinded concentrations, made dose-adjustment recommendations which were forwarded to the treating investigators.
TN|PMC5120936_S87|NEG|NEG|Suspected poor adherence was flagged by the study pharmacist when a >25% discrepancy in doses taken and the pill count was noted.
TN|PMC5120936_S97|NEG|NEG|We aimed to enroll 54 participants in each arm to account for a 10% loss to follow-up or withdrawal.
TN|PMC5120937_S25|NEG|NEG|She was not getting alcohol and tobacco.
TN|PMC5120937_S27|NEG|NEG|She denied any fever, chills, pain, or tenderness.
TN|PMC5120937_S4|NEG|NEG|Atheroma of the facial artery is an extremely rare disease.
TN|PMC5120937_S8|NEG|NEG|The preoperative diagnosis was a right-sided parotid gland tumor.
TN|PMC5120938_S103|NEG|NEG|However, these studies did not analyze data with PVV/GW.
TN|PMC5120938_S110|NEG|NEG|Although several studies have demonstrated the beneficial effect of portal hyperperfusion on hepatic regeneration in LDLT recipients, these studies have certain limitations.
TN|PMC5120938_S111|NEG|NEG|In the study by Eguchi et al,[2] several correlations of mean PVVs measured on POD 1, 7, or 28 with GW/SLV at postoperative week 1 or 2 and postoperative month 1 or 3 were found.
TN|PMC5120938_S112|NEG|NEG|However, the number of patients (n = 15) was too small to achieve sufficient statistical power.
FP|PMC5120938_S113|POS|NEG|Furthermore, the etiology of liver disease was not consistent (4 patients with fulminant hepatic failure and 9 patients with liver cirrhosis).
TN|PMC5120938_S114|NEG|NEG|If fulminant hepatic failure develops in a patient with previously normal hepatic physiology, the amount of PVF to a liver graft would be significantly lower than that of a liver graft transplanted to a cirrhotic patient.[2]
FP|PMC5120938_S115|POS|NEG|Hence, the analysis of a patient group with mixed etiology is inappropriate.
FP|PMC5120938_S116|POS|NEG|In addition, the slice width of their computed tomographic scan (7 mm) for the volumetric study was twice more than ours (3 mm).
TN|PMC5120938_S117|NEG|NEG|Another study, which showed the correlation of difference in PVF per 100 g of GW (PVF/GW) between recipient and donor with percent change in GW between time of graft harvest and postoperative month 2, enrolled 22 patients[8] which is still smaller than number of patients (n = 36) in the present study.
FP|PMC5120938_S118|POS|NEG|In addition, the accuracy of volumetric assessment could not be determined due to the absence of description of the slice width in magnetic resonance imaging.
TN|PMC5120938_S119|NEG|NEG|A more recent study reported the correlations of PVV/GW on POD 1 and PVF/GW on POD 1 and 5 or 6 with the hepatic regeneration rate at postoperative week 7.[10] However, this study also included 3 patients with fulminant hepatic failure and assessed the hepatic regeneration rate earlier than 2 weeks after LDLT, when the effects of early graft edema on the liver graft are still prevalent.
TN|PMC5120938_S120|NEG|NEG|Lastly, Jiang et al's study,[9] which showed the correlations of PVV and PVF on POD 1 and 3 with percent change in GW between preoperative period and POD 30, included only 18 patients.
FP|PMC5120938_S121|POS|NEG|All the above studies standardized only the surgical technique without considering standardization of anesthetic management.
FP|PMC5120938_S122|POS|NEG|To improve the design of our own study, we considered the limitations of previous studies, and estimated the sample size required to achieve a sufficient statistical power, tried to enroll patients with homogeneous etiology, used a uniform surgical and anesthesia protocol, and enhanced the accuracy of the computed tomographic volumetry with thinner slice width.
TN|PMC5120938_S131|NEG|NEG|This study has several limitations as well.
FN|PMC5120938_S135|NEG|POS|Fourth, this study did not evaluate the relationship between hepatic blood flow and regeneration due to poor reproducibility of blood flow estimation using time-velocity integral and diameter of blood vessels.[20]
TP|PMC5120938_S136|POS|POS|Lastly, multicollinearity caused by the high intercorrelations between the velocities, GRWR, and GW/SLV did not allow multivariate analysis in the present study.
TN|PMC5120938_S18|NEG|NEG|Living donor liver transplantation (LDLT) is a well-established treatment for end-stage liver disease, especially in Asian countries with a shortage of cadaveric donors.
TN|PMC5120938_S30|NEG|NEG|After obtaining study approval from Daegu Catholic University Medical Center Institutional Review Board and written informed consent from the patients, this prospective observational cohort study was conducted using 36 consecutive patients undergoing LDLT (31 right-lobe and 5 left-lobe grafts) from March 2013 to January 2014.
TN|PMC5120938_S38|NEG|NEG|Desflurane and remifentanil were regulated to maintain a bispectral index value between 40 and 60 along with mean arterial pressure and heart rate within 25% of preinduction values.
TN|PMC5120938_S54|NEG|NEG|Next, we calculated the ratios of each velocity to 100 g of the initial GW which was obtained immediately after graft retrieval on the day of LDLT.
TN|PMC5120938_S6|NEG|NEG|In this study, we evaluated the effects of graft hyperperfusion on the rate of hepatic regeneration 2 weeks after LDLT by measuring hepatic hemodynamic parameters.
TN|PMC5120938_S68|NEG|NEG|This syndrome is defined as delayed functional hyperbilirubinemia: total serum bilirubin > 20 mg/dL for >7 consecutive days occurring after the 7th POD, excluding technical, immunological, and hepatitis factors.[17]
TN|PMC5120938_S71|NEG|NEG|The primary end point of this study was hepatic regeneration rate at postoperative week 2.
TN|PMC5120938_S72|NEG|NEG|A total of 40 patients were required to achieve a statistical power of 80% with significance level of 0.05 (2-tailed) and drop-out rate of 10%, assuming that the alternative hypothesis of a 0.2 coefficient of determination between peak PVV/100 g of the initial GW (PVV/GW) on POD 1 and hepatic regeneration rate at postoperative week 2 is true.
TN|PMC5120938_S78|NEG|NEG|Simple linear regression analysis was used to investigate the relationship between hepatic hemodynamic parameter values and their values per 100 g of the initial GW on POD 1 and hepatic regeneration rate at postoperative week 2.
TN|PMC5120939_S114|NEG|NEG|Continuous values were expressed with mean and standard deviations.
TN|PMC5120939_S21|NEG|NEG|On the other hand, the prevalence of previously unrecognized PAD is 15% in symptomatic CAD.[5]
TN|PMC5120939_S49|NEG|NEG|Patients with an average heart rate greater than 60 beats per minute (bpm) and no contraindication to beta-blocker received 25 mg atenolol per orally on the evening prior to the examination.
TN|PMC5120939_S52|NEG|NEG|An arrhythmia rejection algorithm was applied in image acquisition.[17]
TN|PMC5120940_S141|NEG|NEG|Our findings indicate that if an accurate diagnosis in made and the appropriate anticoagulation therapy is administered in the perioperative period, living donor renal transplantation can be performed successfully in patients with APS.
TN|PMC5120940_S71|NEG|NEG|She was then started on anticoagulation therapy.
TN|PMC5120940_S83|NEG|NEG|Her serum creatinine level increased to 2.16 mg/dL and repeated DSA testing revealed the development of de novo DSAs and increased MFI of the existing DSAs.
TN|PMC5120940_S87|NEG|NEG|After the treatment, the serum creatinine levels reduced to 1.10 mg/dL.
TN|PMC5120942_S54|NEG|NEG|The patient expressed her explicit desire to undergo restoration of the excised breast tissue.
TN|PMC5120942_S64|NEG|NEG|The 3 ports created for the trocars along the anterior axillary and posterior axillary lines were barely noticeable, and both the patients and the medical staff found that the appearance of the breast in terms of shape, size, and symmetry was satisfactory (Figs. 3 and 4).
TN|PMC5120942_S81|NEG|NEG|In this paper, we present a novel enclosed laparoscopic technique for LDF harvesting, which offers the following advantages over previous techniques: For the entire harvesting procedure, only 3 small trocar ports are necessary, which greatly minimizes the total size of the incisions.
TN|PMC5120942_S89|NEG|NEG|Moreover, during the procedure, care must be taken when the dissection approaches the axilla, although the location of the thoracodorsal pedicle is marked before the operation under ultrasound Doppler guidance.
TN|PMC5120943_S1|NEG|NEG|Statins and risk for new-onset diabetes mellitus
TN|PMC5120943_S113|NEG|NEG|In comparisons 2 and 3, pitavastatin tended to have the lowest HR among the 6 statins but without statistical significance.
TN|PMC5120943_S155|NEG|NEG|Particularly in East Asians, there might be a need to be more cautious regarding the intensity of statin use because relatively less-intensive treatments could bring sufficient lipid-lowering and even plaque regression in those populations compared to Western populations.[36,37]
TN|PMC5120943_S158|NEG|NEG|The present study had several limitations.
TP|PMC5120943_S159|POS|POS|First, the intensity of statin was not considered.
TN|PMC5120943_S160|NEG|NEG|Despite a report on a higher risk for NODM after intensive statin treatment,[35] whether there is a definite correlation between dosage and risk for NODM, as suggested by a recent paper showing an increased risk for NODM even with a low dose of statins in Asian populations,[21] remains controversial.
TN|PMC5120943_S161|NEG|NEG|Previous studies have reported that the mere use of a statin is important for NODM development itself, regardless of the dosage.[8,19,21]
TP|PMC5120943_S162|POS|POS|Second, the comparative risk for NODM between various statins was analyzed as a secondary endpoint; therefore, it was underpowered, and further studies are needed.
TP|PMC5120943_S163|POS|POS|Third, BMI was not available for all of the patients and was not included in the main analysis, and BMI ≥ 25 was used in propensity matching and Cox regression analysis in the subgroup of patients.
FN|PMC5120943_S164|NEG|POS|However, considering that the association between BMI and statin-induced diabetes remains controversial[7,21] and that BMI may exhibit ethnic differences (only 4.7% of the Korean population has a BMI > 30, the level at which it is considered a risk factor for DM[8,38]), a different criteria regarding BMI might be appropriate to apply to East Asians, and these findings need to be prospectively verified in further studies.
TN|PMC5120943_S75|NEG|NEG|In comparison 2, the risk for NODM was compared between patients exposed to a statin and matched nonexposed counterparts.
TN|PMC5120943_S76|NEG|NEG|The matching method and variables used for matching were the same as in comparison 1.
TN|PMC5120943_S83|NEG|NEG|The risk for NODM was compared using Kaplan–Meier analysis with the log-rank test.
TN|PMC5120943_S84|NEG|NEG|The adjusted hazard ratios (HRs) of statin exposure were estimated using Cox proportional hazards regression analysis after adjusting for age, gender, baseline glucose levels (per mg/dL); CCI at the start of observation; whether hypertension was present at the start of observation; and level of exposure to ACEi, ARB, beta-blockers, and thiazide-type diuretics during the observation period.
TN|PMC5120944_S31|NEG|NEG|Herein, we report a case of multiple HAAs in a patient with hepatic HHT in which open arterial reconstruction was effective and obviated the need for major hepatectomy or liver transplantation.
TN|PMC5120944_S45|NEG|NEG|The smaller right HAA gave off the A6 (the artery feeding S6), and the common HAA gave off the gastroduodenal artery (GDA).
TN|PMC5120944_S49|NEG|NEG|These findings suggested the presence of arteriovenous shunts in the left lobe.
TN|PMC5120944_S66|NEG|NEG|Finally, a completion angiogram showed the absence of the 3 aneurysms and that the hepatic blood flow was maintained without anastomotic stenosis or hepatic artery kinking (Fig. 2B).
TN|PMC5120946_S131|NEG|NEG|In contrast, a direct connection between the facial nerve and cochlear nerve has not been reported, even though anastomosis between the cochlear nerve and saccular nerve has been observed.[23]
TN|PMC5120946_S138|NEG|NEG|ENoG revealed more severe degeneration of facial nerve in RHS patients with vertigo than those without vertigo, which consequently suggested the poorer prognosis for facial recovery, even though ENoG values were not significantly different between RHS patients with and without hearing loss.[8]
TN|PMC5120946_S56|NEG|NEG|The maximum SPV was calculated, and when spontaneous nystagmus was present, it was subtracted from the SPV of HVIN.
TN|PMC5120946_S95|NEG|NEG|In patients without facial palsy (n = 22), affected ears exhibited a mean pure tone average of 41.9 ± 17.5 dB, and healthy ears showed a mean pure tone average of 22.3 ± 13.6 dB in the high frequency range.
TN|PMC5120947_S20|NEG|NEG|Widely accepted, surgical resection is the mainstay of the treatment for rectum GSIT invading to the prostate.
TN|PMC5120947_S51|NEG|NEG|The tumor resected was proved to be GIST pathologically.
TN|PMC5120947_S59|NEG|NEG|Some previous studies have reported the GIST invasive to prostate.
TN|PMC5120947_S90|NEG|NEG|We summarized the characteristics of the primary lymphoma of the prostate, sarcoma of the prostate, GIST related to prostate, and the regular prostate carcinoma (Table 2).
TN|PMC5120948_S20|NEG|NEG|Ooto et al[4] have demonstrated changes in individual retinal layer thickness according to age in the eyes of a Japanese population by an automated layer segmentation algorithm.
TN|PMC5120948_S48|NEG|NEG|The mean thicknesses of the pericentral and peripheral rings were measured by averaging the thickness measurements of the 4 corresponding quadrant areas (segments 2 to 5 for the pericentral ring and segments 6 to 9 for the peripheral ring).
TN|PMC5120948_S49|NEG|NEG|Total macular thickness of all areas within the ETDRS grid was automatically calculated by summation of the 9 sectors.
TN|PMC5120948_S87|NEG|NEG|Thus, we can assume that the densities of bipolar cells, amacrine cells, horizontal cells, and Muller cells are likely high in these areas.
TN|PMC5120949_S181|NEG|NEG|Additionally, more researches and development to optimize stent graft designs for endovascular purpose are required to break the present limitations.
TN|PMC5120949_S82|NEG|NEG|The average diameter was 3.4 cm (range: 2.0–6.9 cm).
TN|PMC5120950_S23|NEG|NEG|Although several different methods have been suggested to solve this air leakage problem, they all have numerous disadvantages, including increasing both the cost and time required to perform surgery.
TN|PMC5120950_S24|NEG|NEG|To solve this problem, we devised the novel technique described below and tested its effectiveness in treating wound patients over a period of 2 years.
TN|PMC5120950_S47|NEG|NEG|Vacuum-assisted wound closure was first described by Argenta and Morykwas[1] and Morykwas et al[3] in 1997.
TN|PMC5120950_S58|NEG|NEG|Based on our satisfactory experience, we feel this newly described technique warrants widespread use in treating wounds.
TN|PMC5120951_S15|NEG|NEG|Coronary artery fistula is a congenital or acquired abnormality of coronary anatomy which consists of connections between a coronary artery and cardiac chambers, a coronary vessel, or an intrathoracic vessel.[1]
TN|PMC5120951_S24|NEG|NEG|Transthoracic echocardiography was performed demonstrating normal left ventricular size and function, normal wall motion, and no pericardial effusion.
TN|PMC5120951_S29|NEG|NEG|The huge mass was resected and the proximal and distal openings of the giant aneurysm were ligated.
TN|PMC5120951_S36|NEG|NEG|Coronary artery aneurysms and fistulas are not uncommon in clinical practice by angiography, coronary artery aneurysms are detected in 0.15% to 4.9% of patients who undergo coronary angiography,[3] and coronary artery fistulas are detected in about 0.1% patients.[4]
TN|PMC5120952_S174|NEG|NEG|Another finding was the negative emotional valence and states that were reported by Madame F for the attacks.
TN|PMC5120952_S35|NEG|NEG|For instance, Kazui et al[18] used a story paradigm in which AD patients heard a neutral story and an emotional story describing a child badly hurt in an automobile accident; recall was better for the emotional than for the neutral story.
TN|PMC5120952_S39|NEG|NEG|Taken together, these studies suggest that emotion may alleviate AD-related memory decline, an effect that may also concern flashbulb memories as they are laden with emotional weight.
TN|PMC5120952_S42|NEG|NEG|AD patients were also asked to rate their emotions about the attacks.
TN|PMC5120953_S52|NEG|NEG|All patients received a 0.5 to 3.5-year follow-up by outpatient or telephone, with an average follow-up period of 2.5 years.
TN|PMC5120953_S59|NEG|NEG|Changes of symptoms were associated with the course of disease; patients with relatively shorter disease course were shown to have a mild Hoffman grading, whereas patients with relatively longer disease course were indicated to have a severe Hoffman grading.
TN|PMC5120953_S84|NEG|NEG|TCS caused by different causes may have different curative effects following surgical treatment, for example, if TCS is induced by simply thickening filum terminale, the removal of filum terminale can get better operation results; if it is caused by myelomeningocele, which are usually combined with spina bifida, the operation is relatively complex and surgery is needed to be operated as soon as possible to protect the neurological function, the most important is to suture the dura completely and prevent further TCS.[2]
TN|PMC5120953_S93|NEG|NEG|Klekamp[14] advocated that for small lipoma and cone did not show obvious compression, the symptom is mainly caused by tethered, simply releasing of the tethered is suitable to prevent postoperative adhesion and not to destroy lipoma; and for larger lipoma compressed the conus medullaris, decreasing the volume of lipoma from internal, retaining the capsule, and sewing up the incision will be more effective to reduce the possibility of adhesion.
TN|PMC5120954_S67|NEG|NEG|The color ultrasound follow-up at 6 months after surgery confirmed that the blood flow of the bilateral renal arteries and the superior mesenteric artery was smooth, with no endoleaks of the aneurysm.
TN|PMC5120954_S85|NEG|NEG|Previously, existing studies had described in detail how to carry out physician modification and fenestration in a stent graft body.[9]
TN|PMC5120954_S87|NEG|NEG|The anchoring structure of the Gore Excluder was designed in a range of 9 mm around the proximal end of the stent graft.
TN|PMC5120954_S95|NEG|NEG|The fenestration position can be observed in the fluoroscopy image.
TN|PMC5120955_S15|NEG|NEG|SUVindex may be a predictor of mediastinal LN malignancy in lung cancer patients.
TN|PMC5120955_S29|NEG|NEG|We also evaluated the abilities of these parameters to predict LN malignancy among smokers and nonsmokers, respectively.
TN|PMC5120955_S59|NEG|NEG|We define SUVn/t as LN SUVmax divided by primary tumor SUVmax; SUVindex was defined as SUVn/t multiply by primary tumor largest dimension.
TN|PMC5120955_S7|NEG|NEG|The SUVmax of the primary tumors was >2.0 and the SUVmax of the mediastinal LN stations ranged from 2.0 to 7.0 on PET/CT.

TN|PMC5120956_S60|NEG|NEG|Values of P < 0.05 were considered statistically significant.
TN|PMC5120956_S97|NEG|NEG|The reason may be that the mean degree of scoliotic deformation is different between the patients of the 2 studies.

TN|PMC5120957_S33|NEG|NEG|The purpose of this study was to compare the radiation dose and image quality of retrospective ECG-gated cardiac CT between combined 100-kVp protocol with HIR and display preset optimization and the 120-kVp protocol with FBP.
TN|PMC5120957_S56|NEG|NEG|In all patients, iopamidol 370 mg/mL (Nihon Schering, Osaka, Japan) was delivered over a fixed period of 15 seconds via a 20-gauge catheter inserted into an antecubital vein using a power injector (DUAL SHOT GX; Nemoto-Kyorindo, Tokyo, Japan).
TN|PMC5121105_S121|NEG|NEG|For each 1% energy substitution for 16:0, the estimated absolute risk reductions were 34.4 cases per 100 000 person years for polyunsaturated fat, 28.7 cases per 100 000 person years for whole grain carbohydrates, and 31.5 cases per 100 000 person years for plant proteins.
TN|PMC5121105_S125|NEG|NEG|When mean 12:0-18:0 intake decreased from the highest intake group to the lowest, absolute risk reduction was estimated to be 106.2 cases of coronary heart disease per 100 000 person years when replaced by polyunsaturated fat, 70.9 cases per 100 000 person years by monounsaturated fat, 83.2 cases per 100 000 person years by whole grain carbohydrates, and 94.9 cases per 100 000 person years by plant proteins.
TN|PMC5121105_S128|NEG|NEG|Substitution analysis was stratified by age, body mass index, physical activity, and smoking status (supplementary table 2), and all P values for interaction were greater than 0.05.
TN|PMC5121105_S133|NEG|NEG|In two large prospective cohorts of US men and women, dietary intakes of major individual SFAs—including lauric acid (12:0), myristic acid (14:0), palmitic acid (16:0), and stearic acid (18:0)—were positively associated with risk of coronary heart disease during 24-28 years of follow-up.
TN|PMC5121105_S134|NEG|NEG|Replacement of 1% daily energy intake from the combined group of 12:0-18:0 by equivalent energy from polyunsaturated fat, whole grain carbohydrates, or plant proteins was associated with a 6-8% reduced risk of coronary heart disease.
TN|PMC5121105_S145|NEG|NEG|In a meta-analysis of prospective studies, de Souza and colleagues did not find significant associations between total saturated fat intake and coronary heart disease, but noticed large heterogeneity among estimates from different studies.3
TN|PMC5121105_S146|NEG|NEG|The most plausible reason for such heterogeneity is the inconsistent adjustment of covariates (especially macronutrients) in the individual studies.3
FP|PMC5121105_S147|POS|NEG|As a result, the associations could reflect the effects of substituting SFA for various other macronutrients (depending on the statistical modeling in individual studies), with mixed health effects.
FP|PMC5121105_S148|POS|NEG|Most importantly, without a specified replacement, the comparison is largely with refined starch and sugar because these are the dominant sources of calories in the US diet.
TN|PMC5121105_S149|NEG|NEG|Our previous analysis in the Nurses’ Health Study and the Health Professionals Follow-up Study found a consistently lower risk of coronary heart disease when total saturated fat was replaced by polyunsaturated fat, monounsaturated fat, or whole grain carbohydrates, whereas replacing SFAs with refined carbohydrate was not associated with a lower risk.7
TN|PMC5121105_S150|NEG|NEG|A previous pooling analysis of 11 prospective cohort studies that specified the substituting macronutrient also observed that incidence of coronary heart disease and mortality was 26% and 13% lower, respectively, when 5% energy from saturated fat was replaced by polyunsaturated fat.5
TN|PMC5121105_S151|NEG|NEG|Such findings are in line with a meta-analysis of eight large clinical trials reporting that replacement of 5% energy as saturated fat with polyunsaturated fat led to a 19% reduction in coronary heart disease risk during a median follow-up duration of 4.5 years.6
TN|PMC5121105_S163|NEG|NEG|Palm oil, the most commonly produced edible oil in the world, contains over 40% fat as 16:0, whereas coconut oil and palm kernel oil are high in 12:0 (over 45% fat).33
TN|PMC5121105_S171|NEG|NEG|Several limitations should be discussed as well.
TP|PMC5121105_S172|POS|POS|Firstly, although we adjusted for a multitude of covariates, including demographic characteristics, lifestyle, medical history, and dietary factors, potential unmeasured and residual confounding cannot be excluded.
TP|PMC5121105_S173|POS|POS|Secondly, our study populations exclusively consisted of health professionals with a relatively homogeneous ethnic background and socioeconomic status.
TP|PMC5121105_S174|POS|POS|Although this renders the study results less susceptible to confounding by ethnicity and socioeconomic factors, such homogeneity could limit the generalizability of findings to other ethnic groups or populations with different socioeconomic profiles.
TP|PMC5121105_S175|POS|POS|Thirdly, dietary data derived from food frequency questionnaires are measured, inevitably, with errors.
TP|PMC5121105_S176|POS|POS|Because of the prospective design, these errors are most likely to bias true associations towards the null.
TP|PMC5121105_S177|POS|POS|Lastly, it is difficult to disentangle associations of individual SFAs that are highly correlated with each other in this observational study setting.
TP|PMC5121105_S178|POS|POS|Potential differential effects of individual SFAs on cardiovascular risk warrant further investigation in other cohort studies.
TN|PMC5121105_S20|NEG|NEG|But in practice, calories from SFA have mainly been replaced with low quality carbohydrate,7 which exert clear adverse effects on cardiometabolic disorders such as obesity and diabetes.8
TN|PMC5121105_S27|NEG|NEG|In the current study, we updated the analyses on associations between intake of individual SFAs and risk of coronary heart disease in the Nurses’ Health Study with an extended follow-up of 18 years.
TN|PMC5121105_S34|NEG|NEG|Return of self-administered questionnaires was considered informed consent.
TN|PMC5121105_S35|NEG|NEG|The current analysis was conducted among 81 757 women and 51 529 men who completed a food frequency questionnaire at study baseline (years 1984 for the Nurses’ Health Study and 1986 for the Health Professionals Follow-up Study).
TN|PMC5121105_S45|NEG|NEG|The study baseline year was 1984 for the Nurses’ Health Study, for more comprehensive estimates of individual SFA intake starting from this follow-up cycle.
TN|PMC5121105_S47|NEG|NEG|Participants were asked how often, on average, they had consumed specific foods in the past year, with nine responses ranging from “never” to “at least six times per day” based on a specified standard portion size.
TN|PMC5121105_S6|NEG|NEG|Main outcome measure Incidence of coronary heart disease (n=7035) was self-reported, and related deaths were identified by searching National Death Index or through report of next of kin or postal authority.
TN|PMC5121105_S71|NEG|NEG|Fatal coronary heart disease was confirmed by a review of hospital records or autopsy reports if coronary heart disease was listed as the underlying cause of death and if evidence of previous coronary heart disease was available from medical records.
TN|PMC5121105_S89|NEG|NEG|In this analysis, we first calculated the difference in mean SFA intake between the highest and lowest groups, and then derived the relative risk reduction of coronary heart disease corresponding to this change using hazard ratios in the substitution model above (estimated effects of 1% energy substitution).
TN|PMC5121130_S114|NEG|NEG|Our sample size was based on the assumption that people lost to follow-up would be imputed as not having changed weight: ie, baseline observation carried forward (BOCF).24
TN|PMC5121130_S182|NEG|NEG|On average, individuals in who only received this advice lost more than 1 kg, which is typical of a population motivated to lose weight.29
TN|PMC5121130_S24|NEG|NEG|The reactions of the patients to the general practitioners' brief interventions did not differ significantly between the study groups in terms of appropriateness (adjusted odds ratio 0·89, 95% CI 0·75–1·07, p=0·21) or helpfulness (1·05, 0·89–1·26, p=0·54); overall, four (<1%) patients thought their intervention was inappropriate and unhelpful and 1530 (81%) patients thought it was appropriate and helpful.
TN|PMC5121130_S83|NEG|NEG|The design of the intervention was informed by evidence that an offer of help to change is more motivating than advice to do so.18
TN|PMC5121131_S135|NEG|NEG|The 31 participants lost to follow-up (six during the trial and 25 during follow-up) had no significant associations with treatment group, centre, autism severity, level of adaptive functioning, or any of the demographic measures shown in table 1.
TN|PMC5121131_S162|NEG|NEG|A similar treatment effect is also seen in parent-reported symptom measures at follow-up which, although unblinded, have the potential complementary strengths of being service-user outcome measures and being based on knowledge of the child in naturalistic settings.
TN|PMC5121131_S5|NEG|NEG|We aimed to follow-up the Preschool Autism Communication Trial (PACT), to investigate whether the PACT intervention had a long-term effect on autism symptoms and continued effects on parent and child social interaction.
TN|PMC5121131_S72|NEG|NEG|Assessment of primary outcomes was done by assessors unaware of treatment allocation.
TN|PMC5121182_S131|NEG|NEG|In the SHARP trial, times to deterioration of liver function (Child-Pugh classification) were similar between the sorafenib and placebo arm (data not shown).
TN|PMC5121182_S14|NEG|NEG|Duration of treatment tended to be shorter as the Child-Pugh score worsened.
FN|PMC5121182_S151|NEG|POS|Thus, obtaining background information and treatment trends from real-world practice data in Japanese patients may provide a valuable contribution to the future of HCC treatment.
TN|PMC5121182_S28|NEG|NEG|Progress made in the understanding of the molecular mechanisms involved in the development and proliferation of tumors has enabled the development of effective therapeutic agents (i.e., targeted molecular therapy) for progressive HCC [10, 11].
TN|PMC5122018_S103|NEG|NEG|Finally, in a Phase II study, patients with persistent asthma not controlled by short-acting beta2 agonists had significant FEV1 and evening PEF improvements after receiving FF 100 μg or 200 μg, versus placebo (p ≤0.005 [18]).
TN|PMC5122018_S106|NEG|NEG|In the only two Phase III studies that compared FF with placebo, FF 100 μg demonstrated significant improvements in the proportion of rescue-free 24-h periods versus placebo (14.8%, p <0.001 [23], and 8.7%, p = 0.007 [21]).
TN|PMC5122018_S131|NEG|NEG|Consistent with previous results [37], the data presented here suggest that FF has a wide therapeutic index; the therapeutic dose range was efficacious across individual studies, with a tolerability profile as expected for the class and no evidence of cortisol suppression at the doses assessed.
TN|PMC5122018_S72|NEG|NEG|The most frequently reported AEs for the FF treatment groups in the integrated analysis were headache, nasopharyngitis, upper respiratory tract infection, bronchitis, oropharyngeal pain and cough (Table 3).
TN|PMC5122318_S11|NEG|NEG|It is important to consider diet and lifestyle factors in the evaluation of the association between BMI and mortality.
TN|PMC5122318_S137|NEG|NEG|There are, however, some potential limitations.
TP|PMC5122318_S138|POS|POS|Our cohorts included only health professionals, mostly white men and women, which might limit the generalizability of the findings.
FP|PMC5122318_S139|POS|NEG|The relative homogeneity of the study population in educational attainment and socioeconomic status, however, enhances the internal validity.
TP|PMC5122318_S140|POS|POS|Also, though measurement errors in self reported lifestyle factors are inevitable, because of the prospective design these errors are typically unrelated to the outcomes of the study and are thus likely to have attenuated the observed associations.
TN|PMC5122318_S15|NEG|NEG|Normal weight, defined as a body mass index (BMI) between 18.5-24.9, is a broad reference group containing not only non-smokers who are lean because they are physically active and eating healthy diets but also those who are within the normal BMI range for other reasons that accelerate the ageing process (such as chronic inflammation, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, and neurodegenerative diseases), probably leading to an artificially reduced mortality among the overweight and moderately obese groups.6 7 8 9 10
TN|PMC5122318_S150|NEG|NEG|The U shaped relation between BMI and mortality observed in many epidemiological studies is driven by an over-representation of individuals who are lean because of chronic metabolic and pathological conditions caused by exposure to smoking, a sedentary lifestyle, and/or unhealthy diets, making them more susceptible to death
TN|PMC5122318_S46|NEG|NEG|The correlation between moderate to vigorous activity reported in diaries and that reported on the questionnaires was 0.62.19
TN|PMC5124241_S102|NEG|NEG|The Kolmogorov-Smirnov test with Lilliefors correction was used to assess the normality of data, whereas the Levene median test was used to evaluate the homogeneity of variances.

TP|PMC5124241_S161|POS|POS|instillation of Pseudomonas aeruginosa, and our results cannot be extrapolated to other types of pulmonary infection.
TN|PMC5124241_S162|NEG|NEG|Nevertheless, in a 10-year retrospective study [21], 45.8% of patients had nosocomial-acquired pneumonia caused by Pseudomonas aeruginosa.
FP|PMC5124241_S163|POS|NEG|Furthermore, lungs infected by other pathogens might also benefit from VV-induced responses, e.g., increased production of surfactant.
TP|PMC5124241_S164|POS|POS|Second, the data presented herein refer to the application of variable ventilation during controlled mechanical ventilation, not assisted ventilation, which might have yielded different results.
TP|PMC5124241_S165|POS|POS|Third, unlike in clinical settings, PEEP, respiratory rate, and FiO2 were kept constant.
TN|PMC5124241_S166|NEG|NEG|However, as the main objective was to evaluate VV, confounding factors resulting from changes in ventilator settings were excluded.
TP|PMC5124241_S167|POS|POS|In this line, the level of PEEP used in the current study, while often used in rats, may not be directly extrapolated to the clinical setting.
TN|PMC5124241_S168|NEG|NEG|Nevertheless, it has been estimated that values of PEEP in rats should be multiplied by a factor of 2 to 2.5 [44], when comparing with humans.
FP|PMC5124241_S169|POS|NEG|In our study, this corresponds to 10 to 12.5 cmH2O, i.e., a moderate to high PEEP value in humans.
TN|PMC5124241_S17|NEG|NEG|In PA, compared to VCV, VV reduced perivascular edema (2.5 [2.0–3.75] vs.
TP|PMC5124241_S170|POS|POS|Fourth, the observation time was relatively short (2 h of mechanical ventilation), precluding extrapolation of the findings to longer periods of ventilation.
TP|PMC5124241_S171|POS|POS|Finally, protein levels of biomarkers of VILI were not determined.
TP|PMC5124241_S172|POS|POS|Instead, we chose to assess expression of biomarker mRNA, because an experimental period of 2 h might not be sufficient to detect differences in protein levels [45–48].

TN|PMC5124241_S45|NEG|NEG|We hypothesized that variable ventilation would improve pulmonary function and reduce lung damage without increasing bacterial translocation.
TN|PMC5124241_S54|NEG|NEG|A second catheter (PE-50, Becton, Dickinson and Company) was then placed in the right internal carotid artery for blood sampling and gas analysis (Radiometer ABL80 FLEX, Copenhagen NV, Denmark), as well as monitoring of mean arterial pressure (MAP) (Networked Multiparameter Veterinary Monitor LifeWindow 6000 V; Digicare Animal Health, Boynton Beach, FL, USA).
TN|PMC5124241_S6|NEG|NEG|We investigated the impact of variable ventilation on lung function and histologic damage, as well as markers of lung inflammation, epithelial and endothelial cell damage, and alveolar stress, and bacterial translocation in experimental pneumonia.
TN|PMC5124241_S65|NEG|NEG|Variable ventilation was applied as described in detail elsewhere [15, 16] Briefly, a sequence of randomly generated VT values (normal distribution, mean = 6 mL/kg, coefficient of variation [CV] = 30%, n = 600) was applied in volume-controlled mode using a routine developed by our group (nVentInspira, Dresden, Germany).
TN|PMC5124241_S73|NEG|NEG|The mechanical properties of the lungs, namely elastance (EL) and resistance (RL), were calculated by fitting the signals to the equation of motion, according to transpulmonary pressure (PL = Paw−Pes), as shown in Equation 1:where P0,L is PL at end expiration.
TN|PMC5124241_S79|NEG|NEG|Each feature was scored according to severity, with 0 denoting no effect and 4 denoting maximum severity, and extent, with 0 denoting no appearance and 4 denoting full involvement.
TN|PMC5124241_S88|NEG|NEG|Manual counts of colony forming units (CFU) were performed after 24 h of incubation at 37 °C.
TN|PMC5124241_S90|NEG|NEG|Quantitative real-time reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction (PCR) was performed to measure biomarkers associated with inflammation (interleukin [IL]-6 and cytokine-induced neutrophil chemoattractant [CINC-1]), type II alveolar cell mechanotransduction (surfactant protein-D [SP-D]), endothelial cell injury (angiopoietin [Ang]-2), and alveolar stretch (amphiregulin).
TN|PMC5124241_S92|NEG|NEG|Central slices of the right lung were cut, collected in cryotubes, flash-frozen by immersion in liquid nitrogen, and stored at − 80 °C.
TN|PMC5124273_S153|NEG|NEG|Two assays were performed to assess the possible function of TROP2 in promoting the proliferation of BCs: the CCK-8 assay to measure cell viability which is directly proportional to increases in cell number, and flow cytometry to assess cell cycle progression.
TN|PMC5124273_S207|NEG|NEG|The mechanism of TROP2-induced activation of pERK1/2 in BCs is unclear.
TN|PMC5124273_S51|NEG|NEG|The inclusion criterium for smokers with and without COPD was a smoking index of > 10 pack-years which was calculated by multiplying the number of cigarette packs consumed per day (20 cigarettes per pack) with the number of years of smoking.
TN|PMC5124273_S9|NEG|NEG|Primary airway BCs were isolated by bronchoscopy from healthy individuals and COPD patients and subsequently transfected with pcDNA3.1-TROP2 or siRNA sequence in vitro.
TN|PMC5126840_S100|NEG|NEG|To assess muscularization of pulmonary vessels, all blood vessels ranging from 10–100 μm in diameter were counted in at least four fields at 40× magnification.
TN|PMC5126840_S107|NEG|NEG|The analysis and measurement of α-SMA staining was evaluated by an investigator blinded to treatment groups.

TN|PMC5126992_S127|NEG|NEG|The authors reported that cells survived for at least 28 days.
TN|PMC5126992_S4|NEG|NEG|Whereas the use of soluble factors as agents to modulate the fate of stem cells was established from an early stage of the research with this type of cells, it took longer to recognize that the physical microenvironment locally sensed by stem cells (e.g.
TN|PMC5126992_S69|NEG|NEG|For instance, soft matrices that mimic brain stiffness are neurogenic, while stiffer matrices mimicking muscle are myogenic and more rigid matrices that mimic bone are osteogenic [31].
TN|PMC5127006_S103|NEG|NEG|For IL-1β transfer, an ethanol-supplemented glycin buffer was used.
TN|PMC5127006_S194|NEG|NEG|In line with these findings, we showed here that activation of caspase-1 was able to trigger transformation/differentiation of pleural cells in vitro.
TN|PMC5127006_S30|NEG|NEG|The role of chronic inflammation in human IPF is still controversial.
TN|PMC5127006_S69|NEG|NEG|Statistical analyses were performed by comparing areas under the curve over the whole range in the pleura (0–60 μm) or subpleural (60–500 μm) area.

TN|PMC5129502_S14|NEG|NEG|The establishment of critical differences in PROs distinguishes true responses from random variation and provides insights into appropriate patient management.
TN|PMC5129502_S155|NEG|NEG|In contrast, of the patients who did not achieve a DAS28‐dcrit response at month 12, 59% had no significant PRO responses, and significant improvements in all 3 PROs occurred in only 4%.
TN|PMC5129502_S22|NEG|NEG|We used statistical methods to determine a critical difference (dcrit) required for significant individual patient responses in patient‐reported outcomes (PROs) in patients initiating therapy with adalimumab, a tumor necrosis factor inhibitor, and to evaluate correlations between PROs (pain, fatigue, and function) and objective measures of disease activity, such as the Disease Activity Score in 28 joints (DAS28).Of the 3 PROs evaluated, pain showed the highest correlation with DAS28 and fatigue showed the lowest.
TN|PMC5129502_S94|NEG|NEG|An alternative way of looking at PRO reporting patterns in patients with a therapeutic response at month 12 is presented in Figure 2.
TN|PMC5129580_S168|NEG|NEG|These data support the widely held suspicion that confined placental mosaicism is one source of positive plasma‐based NIPT results followed by normal amniocentesis or CVS.
TN|PMC5129580_S181|NEG|NEG|Therefore, persistent cells from a previous pregnancy are extremely unlikely to be recovered by this method.
TN|PMC5129580_S220|NEG|NEG|We further believe that all of the enrichment, staining, picking, genotyping, amplification, and NGS steps can be automated.
TN|PMC5129580_S246|NEG|NEG|The fully assembled device now contains a step‐gradient of density fluids.
TN|PMC5130923_S122|NEG|NEG|However, this study has some limitations.
TP|PMC5130923_S123|POS|POS|Our data might have a misclassification bias for methods of tumour detection, which could cause either underestimation or overestimation of the incidence rate in specific subgroups.
TN|PMC5130923_S124|NEG|NEG|However, in our study, we used sample weights to calculate an unbiased estimate after adjusting for the non-response units.
FP|PMC5130923_S125|POS|NEG|Indeed, the estimated incidence from NEST data was similar to the real incidence from cancer registry data (see supplementary tables 1 and 2).
TP|PMC5130923_S126|POS|POS|In addition, the estimated proportion of clinically detected cases from our findings in 2008 was similar to those from the Korea National Cancer Screening Survey study in 2009.27 Nevertheless, because of the relatively short follow-up, we could not secure the long term survival outcome data, which is the inherent limitation of this study of thyroid cancer.
TN|PMC5130923_S134|NEG|NEG|To date, the only confirmed risk factor for thyroid cancer is exposure to ionising radiation.34
TN|PMC5130923_S54|NEG|NEG|We used one way analysis of variance to compare the differences in continuous variables by year and a χ2test to compare the differences in categorical variables by year.
TN|PMC5130923_S74|NEG|NEG|The incidence of clinically detected tumours less than 10 mm also showed a modest increase, from 0.49 per 100 000 population in 1999 to 4.88 per 100 000 population in 2008 (absolute difference 4.39).
TN|PMC5130923_S81|NEG|NEG|Overall, between 1999 and 2008 there was a 6.7-fold (95% confidence interval 5.8-fold to 7.8-fold) increase in localised stage tumours and an 8.1-fold (7.2-fold to 9.2-fold) increase in regional stage tumours.
TN|PMC5130923_S90|NEG|NEG|The regional SEER summary stage includes tumours with regional lymph node involvement and those with extrathyroidal extension.
TN|PMC5130924_S101|NEG|NEG|Cases were more often obese (body mass index ≥30: 27.0% v 20.6%) and had more comorbidities, notably polycythaemia, chronic pulmonary disease, congestive heart failure, myocardial infarction, and peripheral vascular disease than did the controls.
TN|PMC5130924_S104|NEG|NEG|Of the 19 215 cases, 69 venous thromboembolisms (0.36%; 28 deep vein thromboses and 41 pulmonary embolisms) occurred during current testosterone treatment and 22 (0.11%; 7 deep vein thromboses and 15 pulmonary embolisms) after recent treatment (table 2).
TN|PMC5130924_S109|NEG|NEG|The rate ratio of venous thromboembolism associated with starting a new course of testosterone treatment within six months was 1.63 (1.12 to 2.37), corresponding to an excess incidence rate of 10.0 (1.9 to 21.6) additional venous thromboembolisms per 10 000 person years, whereas the rate ratio for treatment started longer than six months before the index date was 1.00 (0.68 to 1.47).
TN|PMC5130924_S11|NEG|NEG|The rate ratio after more than six months’ treatment was 1.00 (0.68 to 1.47), and after treatment cessation it was 0.68 (0.43 to 1.07).
TN|PMC5130924_S113|NEG|NEG|In contrast, the rate ratio among patients with pathological hypogonadism was not significant for current testosterone treatment 1.08 (0.75 to 1.55), and it was 1.52 (0.94 to 2.46) for treatment started less than six months before (table 2).
TN|PMC5130924_S115|NEG|NEG|Among patients with at least one known risk factor for venous thromboembolism, the rate ratio was 0.99 (0.65 to 1.49) for current testosterone users and 1.41 (0.82 to 2.41) for those who had started a new course of testosterone treatment within the previous six months.
TN|PMC5130924_S130|NEG|NEG|The first is depletion of susceptible patients,26 with a different proportion of very long term testosterone users among those with and those without pathological hypogonadism (testosterone treatment is lifelong for pathological hypogonadism,2 whereas for men without pathological hypogonadism it is characteristically short term27).
TP|PMC5130924_S132|POS|POS|The limitations of this study include those seen in all observational studies: unmeasured or residual confounding or hidden bias that might exist undetected.
TP|PMC5130924_S133|POS|POS|To minimise residual confounding, we also matched cases to controls on history of individual known risk factors for venous thromboembolism including a medical illness, surgery and trauma, and active cancer within 90 days of the index day.
FP|PMC5130924_S134|POS|NEG|Stratification by presence and absence of known risk factors for venous thromboembolism showed non-significant differences between patients with and without the known risk factor.
FP|PMC5130924_S135|POS|NEG|Although the rate ratios were not statistically different, the difference in magnitudes of effect may be clinically relevant (1.91 v 1.41).
FP|PMC5130924_S136|POS|NEG|Case-control studies are prone to time window bias if the cases and controls are not defined by the same risk sets and the time windows for measuring exposure in cases and controls are not equal.
FP|PMC5130924_S137|POS|NEG|In this study, we avoided time window bias by handling cases and controls in exactly the same way.
TP|PMC5130924_S138|POS|POS|To mitigate the effect of polycythaemia as a potential mediator as well as of prostate cancer, a contraindication for testosterone use that could have altered the testosterone exposure status, we did sensitivity analysis without additional adjustment for polycythaemia and excluding all cases and controls with a history of prostate cancer.
FP|PMC5130924_S139|POS|NEG|The study results remained basically unchanged.
FN|PMC5130924_S140|NEG|POS|Nevertheless, unmeasured confounding remains a limitation.
TP|PMC5130924_S141|POS|POS|Another limitation is the potential for misclassification of exposure due to residual effects of the drug, remaining drug, and/or lack of adherence to treatment after apparent cessation.
FP|PMC5130924_S142|POS|NEG|For this reason, we included a 30 day grace period in the original analysis, and a further sensitivity analysis using a shorter (15 day) and extended (60 day) grace period did not alter the findings.
TP|PMC5130924_S143|POS|POS|The sensitivity of the algorithm for detecting venous thromboembolism was 92.6%, which implies that we may have failed to identify around 7.4% of cases.
FP|PMC5130924_S144|POS|NEG|This would be a problem only if differential identification occurred (identification of venous thromboembolism cases being more likely if they were treated with testosterone).
TN|PMC5130924_S145|NEG|NEG|However, this is unlikely to be the case and is unlikely to have altered the study findings.
TP|PMC5130924_S146|POS|POS|Finally, despite the large number of more than 19 000 venous thromboembolisms in the study population, only 69 cases were currently treated with testosterone, so subgroup analyses were based on even smaller numbers with decreased analytical power.
TN|PMC5130924_S33|NEG|NEG|The CPRD is broadly representative of the UK population in terms of age, sex, and ethnicity.
TN|PMC5130924_S65|NEG|NEG|For all cases and their matched controls, we estimated exposure from all prescriptions for a testosterone product issued before the index date.
TN|PMC5130924_S7|NEG|NEG|Current treatment was subdivided into duration of more or less than six months.
TN|PMC5130924_S74|NEG|NEG|The grace period was to account for residual effects of testosterone or imperfect adherence to the prescribed testosterone regimen (for example, late make-up for missed doses and/or remaining drug after apparent date of cessation).
TN|PMC5130924_S75|NEG|NEG|The coverage days for all testosterone products were based on expert opinion, and the median time between product specific prescriptions was 14 or 84 days for shorter and longer acting testosterone injections, 150 days for implants, and 30 days for products with another (oral, transdermal) route of administration.
TN|PMC5130924_S81|NEG|NEG|Other covariates were body mass index (using cut-offs of 18.5, 25.0, 30.0, and 35.0), smoking and drinking status based on the last information before or on the index date, socioeconomic status, and prescriptions for the following drugs within 90 days of the index date: megestrol, non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs, systemic corticosteroids, and antiplatelets.
TN|PMC5130924_S83|NEG|NEG|We used conditional logistic regression to calculate crude and adjusted odds ratios that are estimates of the incidence rate ratios.
TN|PMC5130924_S96|NEG|NEG|The source population consisted of 2.92 million men.
TN|PMC5130942_S105|NEG|NEG|Physicians in medical school settings were least likely to report rationing.
TN|PMC5130942_S12|NEG|NEG|A total of 2541 respondents, representing 65.6 % of the original mailing list of 3872 US addresses.
TN|PMC5130942_S121|NEG|NEG|Solo practitioners who reported greater rationing behavior may have fewer resources to deal with the paperwork and other barriers; it may be easier not to make the effort in the first place when they know that their efforts will likely be in vain or will not be compensated.
TN|PMC5130942_S122|NEG|NEG|This response, in turn, could relate to feelings of powerlessness associated with our earlier-reported findings that, overall, physicians rated patients, health systems, and malpractice attorneys as more responsible for addressing healthcare costs than they were.1
TN|PMC5130942_S140|NEG|NEG|Findings like these may prompt more honest and sensible professional discourse on this important but controversial topic.
TN|PMC5130942_S141|NEG|NEG|Although we avoided the term “rationing” in the survey, the stigma surrounding the word in the United States may have led to underreporting of actual behavior by study participants.
TN|PMC5130942_S142|NEG|NEG|This study has several limitations.
TP|PMC5130942_S143|POS|POS|Estimates of specialty differences in rationing behavior should be treated with caution, because the AMA Physician Masterfile database relies on self-reported specialty data.
TP|PMC5130942_S144|POS|POS|Moreover, studying self-reported behavior does not directly address the motivations and intentions behind the behavioral choices described herein.
TP|PMC5130942_S145|POS|POS|Similarities or differences between these data and those recorded in Europe several years ago, including potential sampling differences, make it difficult to draw direct and specific comparisons.
TP|PMC5130942_S146|POS|POS|Greater granularity of information regarding the specific practice and patient population characteristics of our respondents would help to further explain the behavior.
TP|PMC5130942_S147|POS|POS|Unfortunately, such data were not available.
TP|PMC5130942_S148|POS|POS|We also acknowledge that non-response bias could be a factor in our study.10 , 11
FP|PMC5130942_S149|POS|NEG|The main contribution of this study is that it goes beyond physician-reported attitudes, to physician self-reported behavior that rationing does occur.
TN|PMC5130942_S150|NEG|NEG|However, with respect to self-reported rationing behavior, even if all of the non-responding physicians had reported “never” rationing, that would still mean that about 35 % of US physicians (1348/3872) reported rationing behavior.
FP|PMC5130942_S151|POS|NEG|Future research could examine the disconnect between physician opinion and behavior when it comes to rationing.
TN|PMC5130942_S16|NEG|NEG|Overall percentage of respondents reporting rationing behavior in various contexts and assessment of attitudes toward rationing.
TN|PMC5130942_S23|NEG|NEG|A more positive opinion about rationing tended to align with greater odds of rationing.
TN|PMC5130942_S57|NEG|NEG|All analyses were performed using SAS version 9.
TN|PMC5130942_S94|NEG|NEG|The overall chi-square test comparing response distributions among the three framing versions was statistically significant (X 2 = 1025.5; p < 0.0001), as were all between-group differences (Group 1 vs.
TN|PMC5132036_S13|NEG|NEG|Significant improvements in PROs with ustekinumab versus placebo were observed in 3 antecedent‐exposure populations of PsA patients, including those with prior MTX and anti‐TNF use.
TN|PMC5132036_S33|NEG|NEG|Patient eligibility criteria and the study designs of the phase 3, randomized, placebo‐controlled PSUMMIT 1 10 and PSUMMIT 2 11 trials have been described.
TN|PMC5132036_S5|NEG|NEG|Patients in the phase 3, PSUMMIT 1 (n = 615) and PSUMMIT 2 (n = 312) studies randomly (1:1:1) received placebo, ustekinumab 45‐mg, or ustekinumab 90‐mg subcutaneous injections at weeks 0, 4, 16, 28, 40, and 52.
TN|PMC5132036_S7|NEG|NEG|In these post hoc analyses, outcomes were compared between the ustekinumab and placebo groups for 3 mutually exclusive antecedent‐exposure populations from the combined studies: MTX/anti‐TNF naive (placebo, n = 56; 45 mg, n = 58; and 90 mg, n = 66), MTX experienced, biologic agent naive (placebo, n = 192; 45 mg, n = 190; and 90 mg, n = 185), and anti‐TNF experienced with or without MTX (placebo, n = 62; 45 mg, n = 60; and 90 mg, n = 58).
TN|PMC5132134_S144|NEG|NEG|Baseline visit was at the time of subsequent (non‐rituximab) biologic initiation.
TN|PMC5132134_S57|NEG|NEG|Potential confounders (measured at baseline and defined as characteristics that differed by time to initiation and were associated with infection in the unadjusted models) were included in the model, and the adjusted hazard ratio (HR) for time to initiation was estimated.
TN|PMC5132134_S6|NEG|NEG|Patients were categorized by duration of time between their last rituximab infusion and initiation of a subsequent biologic agent (≤5 months, 6–11 months, and ≥12 months).
TN|PMC5132134_S82|NEG|NEG|The time to the first infectious event after starting the subsequent biologic agent was similar between patient groups (Figure 1A).
TN|PMC5134764_S126|NEG|NEG|Patients with and without response did not differ in incidence of infections (Table 3; Supplemental Fig. 1C).
TN|PMC5134764_S146|NEG|NEG|However, on long-term follow-up, the frequency of complications did not differ between these 2 groups; the effect of the surgery was probably less important at that time.
FN|PMC5134764_S195|NEG|POS|Moreover, because more than 70% of controls had a chronic ITP (i.e., ITP duration longer than 1 year), the duration of ITP may have influenced the results.
TN|PMC5134764_S87|NEG|NEG|Splenectomy was performed after a median time of 16 months (range 2–140) after ITP diagnosis, by laparotomy in 50 cases (62.5%) or laparoscopy in 30 (37.5%) (3 missing data).
TN|PMC5134765_S118|NEG|NEG|Therefore, on the basis of not reducing the analgesic effect, the prophylactic use of antiemetic drugs or drugs that can reduce the adverse reactions of opioids can improve the postoperative satisfaction rate of analgesia in patients.
TN|PMC5134765_S131|NEG|NEG|In addition, the difference in the VAS scores of patients between the tropisetron and fentanyl groups was not statistically significant, which was also consistent with the study results of Derbent.[20]
TN|PMC5134765_S60|NEG|NEG|The names and doses of the drugs that were administered before, during and after surgery were recorded in detail, and symptomatic treatments were performed for the specific events that appeared during the operation period.
TN|PMC5134765_S77|NEG|NEG|The 2 ends of this scale were labeled as the “0” end and the “10” end, respectively.
TN|PMC5134766_S120|NEG|NEG|Subjects tolerated treatment well, and there were no adverse effects reported in TG.
TN|PMC5134766_S138|NEG|NEG|In the CG, no significant difference was found in the improvement between first and second month (P > 0.05).
TN|PMC5134766_S183|NEG|NEG|A number of animal studies demonstrated that acupuncture can affect a variety of factors potentially related with ICH, such as reducing the expression of cytochrome C and p53 protein to decrease neuronal apoptosis, upregulating the expression of brain-derived neurotrophic factor and nerve growth factor to improve nerve regeneration, downregulating neuron-specific enolase expression to keep neuronal cell membrane integrity.[31]
TN|PMC5134766_S20|NEG|NEG|Primary intracerebral hemorrhage (ICH), the most devastating subtype of stroke, accounts for 10% to 15% of all strokes.[1]
TN|PMC5134767_S116|NEG|NEG|Meen and Chandra[32] reported no improvement in AHI after nasal surgery, but consistent improvement in subjective symptoms of OSA such as sleepiness and overall quality of life.
FN|PMC5134767_S129|NEG|POS|The lack of prospective data collection could have introduced bias into the data because patients were excluded for lack of sufficient data (the main reason of the lack of control group) or missing part of the original 24-hour BP monitoring recordings only accurate hypertension grade were retained.
TN|PMC5134767_S63|NEG|NEG|A P value <0.05 was considered to be statistically significant.
TN|PMC5134767_S93|NEG|NEG|To our knowledge, this large study is the first to examine this topic.
TN|PMC5134768_S10|NEG|NEG|The lesions were removed with biopsy forceps, and cryotherapy was performed.
TN|PMC5134768_S101|NEG|NEG|At present, there is no comparison between various treatment methods for LCH of the tracheobronchial tree.
TN|PMC5134768_S109|NEG|NEG|Reports of recurrence in the tracheobronchial tree are rather scarce.
TN|PMC5134768_S26|NEG|NEG|The patient has signed informed consent giving permission to use of his medical data.
TN|PMC5134769_S1|NEG|NEG|Sensitivity and specificity of dried blood spots for HIV-1 viral load quantification
TN|PMC5134769_S109|NEG|NEG|Especially in settings where patients are monitored just once per year, this is an issue of concern.
TN|PMC5134769_S116|NEG|NEG|This study has a number of strengths and limitations.
FP|PMC5134769_S117|POS|NEG|Strengths include the fact that all evaluations were done in the same laboratory, on the same patient specimens by the same 2 operators whom had several years of experience with VL testing.
FN|PMC5134769_S118|NEG|POS|However, the operators were not blind to the results of the reference test.
TP|PMC5134769_S119|POS|POS|As this evaluation used blood specimens collected from routine monitoring visits, limited volumes were available and all DBS results obtained with 3 different assays were compared to plasma results obtained from the Roche CAP/CTM v2.0 assay only.
FP|PMC5134769_S120|POS|NEG|Inherent differences between the different assays warrant caution when comparing data between assays.[20–24]
FN|PMC5134769_S30|NEG|POS|In addition, most evaluations have been carried out either on a single or on 2 different assays, limiting the possibility to compare across assays.
TN|PMC5134769_S38|NEG|NEG|All consenting HIV-positive patients ≥18 years presenting for VL monitoring as well as people seeking an HIV test between August 2012 and April 2015 were eligible to participate.
TN|PMC5134769_S87|NEG|NEG|Bias between the results on DBS and the reference value was calculated for specimens with a plasma viral load > 1000 cps/mL.
TN|PMC5134770_S28|NEG|NEG|On general physical examination, the patient showed signs of jaundice with upper abdomen tenderness but no guarding.
TN|PMC5134770_S52|NEG|NEG|Written informed consent was obtained from individual participant.
TN|PMC5134770_S65|NEG|NEG|This was also illustrated by the case in Kurihara's report[6] who died of cholangitis despite percutaneous transhepatic catheter drainage.
TN|PMC5134770_S67|NEG|NEG|Despite these efforts, jaundice continued to worsen and was accompanied by recurrent cholangitis.
TN|PMC5134771_S19|NEG|NEG|No obvious complication occurred during the operation and the wound healed well.
TN|PMC5134771_S24|NEG|NEG|Mini-invasive surgery by debridement through XLIF and percutaneous pedicle screwsfixation may be an effective and innovative treatment method for lumbar TB in the elderly.
TN|PMC5134771_S63|NEG|NEG|Instability with damage and kyphosis in 2 vertebral bodies.
TN|PMC5134771_S98|NEG|NEG|Oswestry Disability Index (ODI) and VAS score were decreased at final follow-up, compared with preoperative values (ODI scores: 56 vs 22; VAS scores: 4 vs 0).
TN|PMC5134772_S139|NEG|NEG|Thus, the risk of appearance, aggravation, or improvement of GO in patients with thyroid cancer is unpredicted.
TN|PMC5134772_S147|NEG|NEG|In our analysis, patient with deteriorated GO systematically received a cumulative dose superior to 1.1 GBq (median cumulative dose was 3.7 GBq).
TN|PMC5134772_S33|NEG|NEG|All included manuscripts were reviewed blindly and successively read by 2 endocrinologists in order to complete the dataset.
TN|PMC5134772_S6|NEG|NEG|The aim of this study is to assess the influence of RAI treatment administered for differentiated thyroid cancer on the course of a pre-existing GO.
TN|PMC5134773_S1|NEG|NEG|Whole exome sequencing of independent lung adenocarcinoma, lung squamous cell carcinoma, and malignant peritoneal mesothelioma
TN|PMC5134773_S112|NEG|NEG|Despite the only 2 cycles of carboplatin, considering the interval between treatment and SCC tumor collection (about 14 months), we cannot exclude the mutagenic effect induced by carboplatin.
TN|PMC5134773_S15|NEG|NEG|The incidence of multiple primary tumors (MPT) during an individual's lifetime is increasing, mainly due to the advent of accurate cancer secondary prevention programs and the increase of life expectancy for cancer patients.
TN|PMC5134773_S18|NEG|NEG|Currently, the main criteria for defining the lineage of multiple unrelated intrapulmonary tumors compared with metastatic lesions are based on pathological and clinical assessments.[3,4]
TN|PMC5134774_S118|NEG|NEG|Because it may be difficult to differentiate simple bowel obstruction from strangulated bowel obstruction with a single diagnostic method, we evaluated the predictive ability of abdominal CT combined with initial DNI.
TN|PMC5134774_S130|NEG|NEG|Also, Simon et al reported that, for bacterial infections, serum CRP has little sensitivity and specificity.[28]
TN|PMC5134774_S134|NEG|NEG|In this study, the SG had a shorter time between symptom onset and ED arrival than the NSG.
TN|PMC5134774_S137|NEG|NEG|This study has some limitations.
TP|PMC5134774_S138|POS|POS|First, it has a retrospective design.
TP|PMC5134774_S139|POS|POS|Many types of data are missing, especially those regarding initial symptoms and data from physical examination (e.g., rebound tenderness), and laboratory tests (e.g., initial serum lactate or base excess).
TN|PMC5134774_S140|NEG|NEG|Several experimental studies have demonstrated that lactate level is a useful predictor of intestinal ischemia, and clinical reports have described this parameter as a significant biomedical marker for diagnosing strangulated small bowel obstruction.[29,30]
TP|PMC5134774_S141|POS|POS|In this study, although initial serum lactate level was significantly higher in patients in the SG than in those in the NSG (2.46 vs 1.09, P = 0.001), initial serum lactate was only measured in 93 of 160 patients (58.1%).
TP|PMC5134774_S142|POS|POS|Therefore, we do not present results for initial serum lactate level because it was difficult to compare DNI or MPXI with lactate level.
TP|PMC5134774_S143|POS|POS|Second, since this study was conducted at the emergency center of a single hospital, the sample size was small.
TN|PMC5134774_S144|NEG|NEG|Nevertheless, we investigated all MBO patients who were admitted to this hospital since DNI and MPXI levels became measureable in order to reduce possible biases.
FP|PMC5134774_S145|POS|NEG|Third, DNI and MPXI values can be affected by infection or inflammation out of cause of MBO as well as presence of strangulation.
TN|PMC5134774_S146|NEG|NEG|However, there were no differences in the median results for DNI or MPXI values between the NSG and SG when we analyzed inflammatory markers after controlling for inflammation (DNI: 0% vs 3.2%, P = 0.001 and MPXI: 1.1 vs 1.3, P = 0.252).
TP|PMC5134774_S147|POS|POS|Fourth, because serial DNI and MPXI values were not investigated postoperatively, we did not evaluate their usefulness for evaluating treatment responses by assessing changes in inflammatory markers after definitive treatment.
TP|PMC5134774_S148|POS|POS|Therefore, a prospective study of DNI is needed to expand our current ability to predict complications and serial results after surgery.
TN|PMC5134774_S29|NEG|NEG|HOCl plays an important defensive role against bacteria, fungi, and viruses.[18]
TN|PMC5134774_S39|NEG|NEG|This is a retrospective and observational study of consecutive patients 18 years or older who visited our hospital for MBO over a 31-month period (2012–2014, since DNI analysis was implemented).
TN|PMC5134774_S4|NEG|NEG|There have been no previous reports of predicting strangulation in MBO cases using the delta neutrophil index (DNI), which is a measure of the proportion of circulating immature granulocytes, or the myeloperoxidase index (MPXI), which is a measure of serum myeloperoxidase level.
TN|PMC5134774_S53|NEG|NEG|The study coordinators monitored the performance of the abstractors.
TN|PMC5134774_S74|NEG|NEG|Normality was assessed using the Shapiro–Wilk test.
TN|PMC5134774_S78|NEG|NEG|Additionally, the ability of each method to predict the presence of strangulated bowel obstruction was compared using the area under the curve (AUC).
TN|PMC5134774_S8|NEG|NEG|Patients were categorized by a strangulation group (SG) and nonstrangulation group (NSG).
TN|PMC5134774_S93|NEG|NEG|The most common cause of strangulation was adhesion (66.9%), followed by carcinoma (16.3%), and bowel inflammation (9.4%).
TN|PMC5134774_S94|NEG|NEG|One hundred twenty-two patients (77.7%) had small bowel obstruction (Tables 1 and 2).
TN|PMC5134775_S101|NEG|NEG|Postoperative complications in LG were: wound infection (13.8%; N = 4), bowel obstruction (3.4%; N = 1), and postoperative bleeding (3.4%; N = 1).
TN|PMC5134775_S141|NEG|NEG|Obviously, bowel function recovery would be faster in TLG because of short exposure time during operation and less surgical trauma.
TN|PMC5134775_S148|NEG|NEG|Other than tattooing of the lesion with India ink prior to surgery,[27] we routinely place 3 titanium clips to serve as landmarks adjacent to the tumor during colonoscopy examination and biopsy for better tumor localization during surgery.
TN|PMC5134775_S59|NEG|NEG|The ileocolic vessels were identified and elevated, and the peritoneum was incised laterally to the ileocolic vessels and superior mesenteric vein.
TN|PMC5134776_S100|NEG|NEG|The PEG balloon was pulled up to compress the bleeding site, resulting in reduction of the oozing.
TN|PMC5134776_S131|NEG|NEG|The patient in this case was obese and had a large stomach.
TN|PMC5134776_S73|NEG|NEG|The balloon at the end of the PEG tube was inflated with 5 mL of sterile water, and the PEG tube was pulled until appropriate approximation of the balloon to the gastric wall was achieved (Fig. 2, see Video, Supplemental Digital Content 1 which shows the PEG insertion).
TN|PMC5134776_S97|NEG|NEG|Postprocedural bleeding occurred in an 89-year-old man who underwent PEG for aspiration due to dementia.
TN|PMC5134777_S105|NEG|NEG|The effect of short-term treatment of hypertension on the incidence of stroke and total death were studied more than 5 years after the project.
TN|PMC5134777_S114|NEG|NEG|There was a 60% decrease in deaths from stroke and 50% decrease in overall death in the intervention group compared with the control group.
TN|PMC5134777_S124|NEG|NEG|The present study has several limitations.
TP|PMC5134777_S125|POS|POS|First, there were significant differences in the baseline data between the groups.
TP|PMC5134777_S126|POS|POS|Although propensity scoring and sensitivity analyses were carried out, important confounders may have been missed.
TP|PMC5134777_S127|POS|POS|Second, the study is limited by the limitations of the health record system.
TP|PMC5134777_S128|POS|POS|It was not possible to adjust for all factors that affect the risk of stroke, such as lipid status, hypertension, or family history.
TP|PMC5134777_S129|POS|POS|Third, the doctors’ practices were not evaluated during and after the program, and it was not clear whether their practices were retained at the time of follow-up.
FN|PMC5134777_S130|NEG|POS|The rate of lost to follow up was near 30%, this maybe have biased the result assessment, although it was reported that a loss to follow-up of 22% would not bias conclusions.[41]
TP|PMC5134777_S131|POS|POS|Finally, ascertainment bias may have affected the results.
TP|PMC5134777_S132|POS|POS|For example, some strokes may have been missed if they led immediately to death.
TN|PMC5134777_S67|NEG|NEG|The sitting BP was measured twice at 1-minute intervals and once after the patient had remained seated for 5 minutes.
TN|PMC5134777_S70|NEG|NEG|Hypertension was defined as a systolic BP of 140 mmHg or more, diastolic BP or 90 mmHg or more, or use of an antihypertensive drug.
TN|PMC5134777_S71|NEG|NEG|Smoking was defined as the use of at least one cigarette per day.
TN|PMC5134777_S81|NEG|NEG|The patients were matched using 5:1 digit matching.
TN|PMC5134777_S87|NEG|NEG|Cox models were used after excluding 161 patients with cardiovascular diseases at baseline and 14 patients with stroke or death in the first year.
TN|PMC5134777_S95|NEG|NEG|After propensity score matching, there were 1078 participants in each group, and the characteristics of the participants in both groups were similar (P > 0.05, Table 1).
TN|PMC5134777_S99|NEG|NEG|After propensity score matching, 110 strokes (2.0% vs 4.6%) and 141 deaths (1.4% vs 3.8%) occurred in the matched intervention and control pairs (n = 1078).
TP|PMC5134778_S100|POS|POS|Secondly, because this study was performed by experienced anesthesiologists using the McGrath VL, our results might not completely extrapolate to the novice.
TP|PMC5134778_S101|POS|POS|Thirdly, since we used only the McGrath VL, other indirect VLs, which have different features associated with a blade, might have different results concerning stylet use.
TP|PMC5134778_S102|POS|POS|Further study might be needed to elucidate the effect of stylet use according to different VLs.
TN|PMC5134778_S37|NEG|NEG|Patients received no premedication prior to surgery.
TN|PMC5134778_S46|NEG|NEG|In the stylet group, a malleable intubating stylet (Covidien, Ireland) with a hockey-stick curvature was inserted in the endotracheal tube, after which the distal tip of tube was bent just above the cuff to a 60° angle.
TN|PMC5134778_S51|NEG|NEG|The anesthesiologists performing the intubation accessed laryngoscopic views according to the Cormack and Lehane grade.
TN|PMC5134778_S66|NEG|NEG|There were no significant differences in patient characteristics and airway assessment findings between the groups (Table 1).
TN|PMC5134778_S8|NEG|NEG|One hundred forty patients, ages 19 to 70 years (American Society of Anesthesiologists physical status I–II), undergoing tracheal intubation for elective surgery were randomly allocated to the nonstylet group (n = 70) or the stylet group (n = 70).
TN|PMC5134778_S83|NEG|NEG|Stylet use can essentially compensate for the geometrical weaknesses of indirect VL and may play an important role during intubation using McGrath VL.[16]
TN|PMC5134778_S97|NEG|NEG|This study has some limitations.
TP|PMC5134778_S98|POS|POS|Firstly, the experienced anesthesiologists were not blinded to the use or nonuse of stylets.
FN|PMC5134778_S99|NEG|POS|Hawthorne effects might have affected the performance during intubation and the results.[18]
TN|PMC5134779_S148|NEG|NEG|Given that the risk of hemorrhage persists as long as the INH persists, the latter should thereby be eliminated as quickly as possible.
TN|PMC5134779_S149|NEG|NEG|Therefore, it seems to be essential to pinpoint the factors predicting a response to corticosteroids alone in order to identify patients not requiring a potentially harmful increase in immunosuppressive treatments that expose to more severe and frequent infectious processes.
TN|PMC5134779_S26|NEG|NEG|Furthermore, patients involved in AH are often elderly, presenting with several debilitating comorbidities, or exhibiting autoimmune or neoplastic diseases, with thereby an increased risk of infection because of the intense immunosuppressive impact.
TN|PMC5134779_S30|NEG|NEG|It was recently suggested that in patients treated with corticosteroids alone, the subgroup with FVIII ≥ 1 IU/dL and an INH titer ≤20 Bethesda units per milliliter (BU/mL) was the most likely to obtain partial remission (PR) at 21 days, which is defined by increase in FVIII levels exceeding 50 IU/dL and disappearance of the clinical signs of hemorrhage.[7]
TN|PMC5134780_S114|NEG|NEG|When TKA is planned in patients at high risk of thromboembolism or adverse cardiac events, bridging therapy can be initiated.[19,20]
TN|PMC5134780_S121|NEG|NEG|This study has several limitations.
TP|PMC5134780_S122|POS|POS|First, data were collected from a single center; hence, the results can not be generalized for other institutions.
FN|PMC5134780_S123|NEG|POS|Furthermore, this study was of a retrospective design, which has inherent weaknesses.
TP|PMC5134780_S124|POS|POS|Larger prospective studies based on multicenter data are required.
TP|PMC5134780_S125|POS|POS|Additionally, there was no transfusion protocol to ensure the consistency of decision-making regarding blood transfusion.
TP|PMC5134780_S126|POS|POS|Thus, surgeons decided the transfusion requirements of the patients on a case-by-case basis.
TP|PMC5134780_S127|POS|POS|Finally, as only a few patients were receiving each antithrombotic agent, with the exception of aspirin, no subgroup analysis according to the type of antithrombotic agents was performed.
TP|PMC5134780_S128|POS|POS|Perioperative outcomes following discontinuation of each type of antithrombotic agent should be further evaluated.
TN|PMC5134780_S34|NEG|NEG|The following procedure subtypes were also recorded: unilateral TKA, staged bilateral TKA (different operations during the same hospitalization), and simultaneous bilateral TKA (operation on the same day).
TN|PMC5134780_S42|NEG|NEG|Secondary outcome included intraoperative estimated blood loss, perioperative blood transfusion, and postoperative hospital stay.
TN|PMC5134780_S47|NEG|NEG|With this method, weights for patients who did not receive antithrombotic agents preoperatively were the inverse of (1 − propensity score) and weights for patients who stopped antithrombotic medication preoperatively were the inverse of the propensity score.
TN|PMC5134780_S63|NEG|NEG|The incidences of postoperative 30-day complications are presented in Table 3.
TN|PMC5134780_S64|NEG|NEG|Postoperative cardiovascular complications occurred more frequently in group A compared with group B (P = 0.035).
TN|PMC5134780_S84|NEG|NEG|TKA is most commonly performed for osteoarthritis, and for other knee diseases such as rheumatoid arthritis and psoriatic arthritis.
TN|PMC5134780_S99|NEG|NEG|In principle, evaluating the perioperative complications related to the cessation of antithrombotic therapy requires inclusion of patients who maintain perioperative antithrombotic therapy.
TN|PMC5134781_S110|NEG|NEG|In case series, LP is commonly treated with oral glucocorticoids and hydroxychloroquine.[3]
TN|PMC5134781_S15|NEG|NEG|After confirmation of this diagnosis by a deep-skin biopsy, our patient was treated with systemic glucocorticoids.
TN|PMC5134781_S6|NEG|NEG|In certain cases, diagnosing LP may be challenging.
TN|PMC5134781_S98|NEG|NEG|In retrospect, several findings had argued against a bacterial skin infection.
FN|PMC5134796_S146|NEG|POS|In addition, we cannot ignore the pitfalls inherent in any systematic review, including the relatively small number of identified patients, the retrospective design, and incomplete follow-up data in some cases.
TN|PMC5134796_S24|NEG|NEG|Symptoms generally begin with coldness of the fingers and toes, and intermittent claudication, then progress to ischemic pain at rest, and ultimately result in the development of ischemic ulcerations and gangrene that can necessitate amputation.[1,2]
TN|PMC5134796_S39|NEG|NEG|The sample included eight patients with TA recruited at three hospitals in Barcelona (Spain), all fullfiling the diagnostic criteria proposed by Olin et al[1,2] and Shinoya et al[16]: onset before the age of 50 years; current (or recent past) tobacco use; distal extremity ischemia (infrapopliteal and/or intrabrachial), such as claudication, rest pain, ischemic ulcers, and gangrene documented with noninvasive testing; exclusion of connective tissue diseases and hypercoagulable states; exclusion of a proximal source of emboli with echocardiography and arteriography; and consistent arteriographic findings in the involved and clinically uninvolved limbs including multiple segmental occlusions of distal arterial sections (distally from the elbow and knee); chronic vascular occlusion due to secondary thrombosis; absence of atherosclerotic lesions, such as calcification of vascular walls; tapering and abrupt obstruction of vessels, a twisting course of the involved vessels; and “corkscrew” or “tree-root” collaterals.
TN|PMC5134796_S86|NEG|NEG|The remaining patient only had ischemic pain at rest in the legs with skin integrity at baseline.
TN|PMC5134797_S72|NEG|NEG|Davis et al[8] found that active pulmonary tuberculosis mainly presented high uptake of F-18 FDG, whereas treated or obsolete pulmonary tuberculosis mainly presented nonuptake or mild/intermediate uptake of F-18 FDG (SUV < 2.5).
TN|PMC5134797_S78|NEG|NEG|The expression of Glut-1 and Glut-3 in these pathological tissues was detected, and these results indicated low F-18 FDG uptake and low expression of Glut-1 and Glut-3 in most of the inflammatory lesions.
TN|PMC5134797_S93|NEG|NEG|This finding might be due to the down-regulated Glut receptors on the cell membrane of the inflammatory cells, the smaller amount of inflammatory cells and the fibroblasts as a main cell component in larger lesions.
TN|PMC5134797_S97|NEG|NEG|Some of the pulmonary inflammatory lesions with F-18 FDG uptake can cause false positive results of PET tumor imaging.
TN|PMC5134798_S10|NEG|NEG|The diameters of right radial artery and ulnar artery were measured by ultrasound on admission and before artery puncture.
TN|PMC5134798_S12|NEG|NEG|Secondary endpoints were the number of difficult procedures, and the incidence of puncture failure.
TP|PMC5134798_S123|POS|POS|This study is limited by its single-center study design; therefore, our findings should primarily be viewed as hypothesis generating.
TP|PMC5134798_S124|POS|POS|Despite the use of an observer and the lab timer, we cannot exclude a bias in the performance, measurement, or recording of the procedure or clinical data.
TP|PMC5134798_S125|POS|POS|The second, the open-label design may increase the possibility of bias.
TP|PMC5134798_S126|POS|POS|That is, patients or operators may be influenced by their knowledge of the procedure.
TN|PMC5134798_S17|NEG|NEG|In addition, the proportion of difficult procedures of UC group was less than that of standard group (4.61% vs 10.92%, P = 0.013).
TN|PMC5134798_S68|NEG|NEG|Puncture failure was defined as the guidewire failed to insert.
TN|PMC5134799_S24|NEG|NEG|During the past 2 decades, numerous epidemiological studies have investigated the relationships of the MTHFR C677T and A1298C polymorphisms with various diseases, including birth defects, cardiovascular diseases, pregnancy complications, lymphoblastic leukemia, rheumatoid arthritis, and breast cancer, although the results were still inconsistent.[1,9–15]
TN|PMC5134799_S46|NEG|NEG|After obtaining due informed consent, buccal smears were collected, dried at room temperature for 1 hour, and then sent to the central laboratory in Shanghai.
TN|PMC5134799_S60|NEG|NEG|The comparison of the combined genotype and haplotype frequencies among the 9 populations was examined using Kruskal–Wallis test.
TN|PMC5134799_S99|NEG|NEG|The mean frequency of the CT/AC genotype in our study was 13.7%, which is similar to that of Mexicans, but lower than that of Turks, French, and Italians, and higher than that of Africans.[30–33]
TN|PMC5134800_S3|NEG|NEG|The aim of this study was to investigate the long-term results of computed tomography (CT)-guided percutaneous radiofrequency thermocoagulation (PRT) for glossopharyngeal neuralgia (GPN).
TN|PMC5134800_S49|NEG|NEG|The glossopharyngeal was thermally coagulated with radiofrequency at 70°C to 85°C for 120 to 180 seconds, depending on the stimulation reaction and experience of the physician.
TN|PMC5134800_S50|NEG|NEG|Hemodynamics was carefully monitored during such interventional procedure.
TN|PMC5134800_S62|NEG|NEG|At the time of hospital discharge, 63 (78.8%) patients were pain-free.
TN|PMC5134801_S117|NEG|NEG|Nevertheless, satisfactory and definitive results have not been obtained regarding candidate molecules and scores to predict the outcome of patients with vasculitis admitted to ICU.
FN|PMC5134801_S126|NEG|POS|It is important to note that the BVAS was not originally designed for patients admitted to the intensive care and with life-threatening complications.
TN|PMC5134801_S82|NEG|NEG|These diseases may often cause life-threatening complications requiring admission to ICU[13,14] depending on several factors: the exposure to external agents, mostly infections, the therapy, which usually results in immunosuppression, and the comorbidities of the patient.[13,15]
TN|PMC5134801_S91|NEG|NEG|The BVAS/WG is a score designed to measure the level of disease activity, by identifying all the possible organ clinical manifestations.
TN|PMC5134802_S114|NEG|NEG|No dearth occurred in both groups.
TN|PMC5134802_S119|NEG|NEG|As shown in Table 4, the Syntax score were significantly positively correlated with smoking (r = 0.214, P = 0.004), diabetes history (r = 0.196, P = 0.008), plasma UA levels (r = 0.421, P < 0.001), fasting blood glucose (FBG) (r = 0.168, P = 0.024), CAC score (r = 0.305, P < 0.001), number of diseased vessels (r = 0.667, P < 0.001), and MACE (r = 0.238, P = 0.001).
TN|PMC5134802_S14|NEG|NEG|Kaplan–Meier analysis showed patients in the high plasma ADAMTS-7 group tend to have a lower event-free survival rate than patients in the low plasma ADAMTS-7 group, unfortunately, no difference was detected (86.8% vs 88.0%, log rank = 0.314, P = 0.575).
FN|PMC5134802_S159|NEG|POS|The present study is a single-center, retrospective study with its inherent limitations.
TP|PMC5134802_S160|POS|POS|First, a relative small number of patients were enrolled.
TP|PMC5134802_S161|POS|POS|Second, it was a cross-sectional study.
TP|PMC5134802_S162|POS|POS|It is very difficult for us to set completely healthy population as control group, so it could not deduce a casual connection.
TP|PMC5134802_S163|POS|POS|Moreover, there is no established reference of plasma ADAMTS-7 level available from large-scale clinical trials among the same patient population so the cutoff value in the present study is purely suggestive.
TP|PMC5134802_S164|POS|POS|Finally, large sample size and better design studies including detailed information such as imaging intravascular ultrasound data are required to further evaluate the potential mechanisms involving the role of ADAMTS-7.
TN|PMC5134802_S28|NEG|NEG|However, its value to predict major adverse cardiovascular event (MACE) was validated in stable CAD patients.[9]
TN|PMC5134802_S56|NEG|NEG|The coefficient of variation for intra- and inter-assay variation was less than 10% and 12%, respectively.
TN|PMC5134802_S7|NEG|NEG|All patients were divided into subgroup according to the ADAMTS-7 median in this cohort: high group with ADAMTS-7 ≥0.99 ng/mL and low group with ADAMTS-7 <0.99 ng/mL.
TN|PMC5134803_S44|NEG|NEG|The categorical data were compared with the χ2 test or Fisher exact test as appropriate.
TN|PMC5134803_S5|NEG|NEG|The purpose of this study was to investigate the ability of preoperative APRI to predict short-term outcomes following liver resection for HCC.
TN|PMC5134803_S61|NEG|NEG|Table 2 shows the classification of complications.
TN|PMC5134803_S95|NEG|NEG|The different geographical areas and different HCC etiologies may contribute to the difference.
TN|PMC5134805_S102|NEG|NEG|The mechanisms by which viral reactivations and relapse prevention could be linked remain unclear.
TN|PMC5134805_S43|NEG|NEG|All patients underwent twice-weekly surveillance of CMV reactivation by pp65 antigenemia (≥1 pp65-antigene-positive cell per 2 slides with >2.0 × 105 white blood cells per slide) from 2000 to 2005 or real-time qPCR testing (2 consecutive positive PCR ≥ 500 copies/mL) thereafter, from the engraftment until 100 days after alloSCT.
TN|PMC5134805_S67|NEG|NEG|When the linearity hypothesis was not respected, continuous variables were transformed into ordered data.
TN|PMC5134805_S94|NEG|NEG|In the group of patients who experienced viral reactivations, 10 year-OS was 63% (95% CI 49–74) compared with 41% (95% CI 27–55) in the group of patients without reactivation (P = 0.10) (Fig. 1D).
TN|PMC5134806_S7|NEG|NEG|But far less published literature focus on the imaging characteristics of AMFB.
TN|PMC5134806_S70|NEG|NEG|After administration of intravenous contrast medium, AAM shows strong enhancement with swirled central strands of hypointense tissue caused by stretching of the fibrovascular stroma during protrusion.[9]
TN|PMC5134806_S74|NEG|NEG|Hypointensity in T2-weighted images and spoke wheel pattern of enhancement are the typical imaging features of SFT.[12]
TN|PMC5134806_S79|NEG|NEG|The diagnosis of AMFB is based on several findings including clinical, radiological, and histological data.
TN|PMC5134807_S145|NEG|NEG|Saliva proved to be a particularly convenient source for virus detection in asymptomatic HHV-8 infection, despite intermittent viral salivary shedding and low HHV-8 load in absence of the KS tumor.[25,27,45,46]
TN|PMC5134807_S171|NEG|NEG|Our study, however, has some limitations.
TP|PMC5134807_S172|POS|POS|First, it was not possible to obtain serially CD4 count and HIV viral load, so it would be very useful to verify some additional relationship with clinical progression of KS.
TP|PMC5134807_S173|POS|POS|Second, the limited number of samples analyzed precludes detailed investigation on the impact of ethnicity on HHV-8 genotypes.
TN|PMC5134807_S177|NEG|NEG|However, it was possible to suggest that genotype B might be associated with better tumor prognosis in the KS group.
TN|PMC5134807_S82|NEG|NEG|PCR products were purified by using the QIAquick PCR Purification Kit (QIAGEN) and quantified with low DNA Mass ladder (Gibco).
TN|PMC5134809_S16|NEG|NEG|And laminectomy of the atlas with duroplasty provided satisfied outcome.
TN|PMC5134809_S49|NEG|NEG|The patient received 3-month systematic physiotherapy.
TN|PMC5134809_S58|NEG|NEG|They conclude that atlas with an inner sagittal diameter of 26 mm or less can be described as hypoplastic.[23]
TN|PMC5134809_S8|NEG|NEG|Cervical myelopathy resulting from atlas hypoplasia and ossification of the posterior atlantoaxial membrane.
TN|PMC5134811_S45|NEG|NEG|Smoking was defined as at least 1 cigarette per day for >1 year.
TN|PMC5134811_S67|NEG|NEG|The MMSE assesses orientation to time and place, attention, calculation and construction, learning, language, and memory, with a range of 0 to 30.[13] Higher scores indicate better performance.
TN|PMC5134811_S74|NEG|NEG|The association between cumulative SBP and MMSE score was analyzed using a multivariate linear regression.
TN|PMC5134811_S87|NEG|NEG|For the 2211 participants, the mean age was 51.04 ± 10.56 years.
TN|PMC5134812_S105|NEG|NEG|For clinico-pathologic variables (Table 1), only HER-2 status significantly differed between early and late recurrence.
TN|PMC5134812_S112|NEG|NEG|Among the tested clinico-pathologic variables (Table 3), stage III, T stage ≥ T2, N stage ≥ N2, ER negativity, PR negativity, Ki-67 positivity, histologic grade III, and nuclear grade III were significantly associated with overall recurrence.
TN|PMC5134812_S115|NEG|NEG|Among the tested DCE-MRI features (Table 4), moderate or marked BPE (hazard ratio [HR], 2.13; 95% confidence interval [CI], 1.35–3.37), rim enhancement (HR, 3.56; 95% CI, 2.27–5.60), and prominent increased ipsilateral whole-breast vascularity (HR, 4.44; 95% CI, 2.52–7.80) were significantly associated with overall recurrence.
TN|PMC5134812_S12|NEG|NEG|Breast cancer is one of the most common causes of cancer-related death in women worldwide.[1]
TN|PMC5134812_S145|NEG|NEG|One possibility is that angiogenic stimulation by breast cancer involves not only microvessels, but also larger vessels.
TN|PMC5134812_S165|NEG|NEG|However, DCE-MRI is a noninvasive imaging modality for preoperative evaluation of tumor characteristics and staging through tumor vascularity.
TN|PMC5134812_S167|NEG|NEG|This study has some limitations.
TP|PMC5134812_S168|POS|POS|First, this study included a small number of patients with breast cancer recurrence from a single institution.
TP|PMC5134812_S169|POS|POS|Therefore, our patients might not be representative of the general population.
TP|PMC5134812_S170|POS|POS|Second, this study was retrospective and the follow-up period was not long enough (median follow-up, 62.3 months), considering that the luminal subtype of breast cancer may recur even after 10 years.
TP|PMC5134812_S171|POS|POS|Third, 13% of the eligible 694 patients were lost to follow-up, which might have introduced bias.
TN|PMC5134812_S172|NEG|NEG|However, no significant difference was found between the group of loss to follow-up and the enrolled group in clinico-pathologic features except patient age.
FP|PMC5134812_S173|POS|NEG|The age difference between 2 groups would be unlikely to affect the study results.
TP|PMC5134812_S174|POS|POS|Fourth, we did not evaluate the status of adjuvant hormonal therapy or adjuvant chemotherapy, which could have affected the recurrence period.
TP|PMC5134812_S175|POS|POS|Lastly, MR imaging was not scheduled according to the women's menstrual cycles, which could have affected the BPE.
FP|PMC5134812_S176|POS|NEG|Although scheduling of screening MR imaging in the second week of a woman's menstrual cycle is routinely recommended to minimize the effect of BPE, diagnostic MR imaging for staging of breast cancer is usually performed regardless of the menstrual cycle.
TN|PMC5134812_S3|NEG|NEG|The aim of the study was to evaluate dynamic contrast-enhanced breast magnetic resonance imaging (DCE-MRI) features for the prediction of early and late recurrences in patients with breast cancer.
TN|PMC5134812_S47|NEG|NEG|Standard subtraction images were obtained by subtracting the precontrast images from the second dynamic series (or early peak) of postcontrast images on a pixel-by-pixel basis.
TN|PMC5134812_S58|NEG|NEG|A region of interest (ROI) was placed on the fastest-enhancing area or the area showing the most suspicious washout curve pattern of the lesion.
TN|PMC5134812_S88|NEG|NEG|Univariate analysis was performed to compare DCE-MRI and clinico-pathologic features between no recurrence and early or late recurrence groups using the log-rank test.
TN|PMC5134813_S132|NEG|NEG|From these 4 findings, other possible complications can arise, including pneumothorax, hydropneumothorax, and pneumomediastinum.
TN|PMC5134813_S146|NEG|NEG|In our case 1, we identified small centrilobular nodules with tree-in bud pattern, which did not involve airways, and was consistent with of endovascular and perivascular spread/growth of small tumor emboli.
TN|PMC5134813_S48|NEG|NEG|The patient underwent CT-guided biopsy of sacrum that confirmed presence of angiosarcoma showing vasoformative regions and confirmed as endothelial in origin by immunohistochemistry (CD31) (Fig. 2).
TN|PMC5134813_S53|NEG|NEG|The histological findings were highly suggestive of epithelioid angiosarcoma.
TN|PMC5134814_S11|NEG|NEG|In adults from regions with adequate and more than adequate iodine intake, we found that Tg may be a suitable marker of iodine status; gender-specific Tg RI was unnecessary; there was no difference between Tg RIs in regions with adequate and more than adequate iodine intake; and the TSH criterion for selecting the Tg reference population could follow the local TSH reference rather than 0.5 to 2.0 mIU/L.
TN|PMC5134814_S129|NEG|NEG|The current study had several limitations.
TP|PMC5134814_S130|POS|POS|First, the thyroid indexes did not include serum triiodothyronine (T3) or thyroxine (T4).
FP|PMC5134814_S131|POS|NEG|Although the NACB guideline for Tg RI determination does not require these parameters, there may be certain individuals who have TSH levels within the reference values but abnormal T3 or T4 levels.
TP|PMC5134814_S132|POS|POS|Second, there were more women than men in this study (male:female ≈ 1:2), because in China, women are usually more concerned about health, and as such, are willing to participate in these type of studies.
TN|PMC5134814_S133|NEG|NEG|However, because no significant differences in Tg levels were found between genders, this gender-specific imbalance of Tg seemed to have minor effects on our conclusions.
TP|PMC5134814_S134|POS|POS|Finally, this is a cross-sectional study; thus, the causal relationship between Tg and iodine intake could not be well established.
TN|PMC5134814_S56|NEG|NEG|The research protocols were carefully explained.
TN|PMC5134814_S6|NEG|NEG|Serum Tg, thyroid-stimulating hormone (TSH), thyroid peroxidase antibody (TPOAb), Tg antibody (TgAb), and urinary iodine concentration (UIC) were measured.
TN|PMC5134814_S63|NEG|NEG|A total of 1157 subjects (515 men, 642 women, aged 44.9 ± 15.2 years) from Guangzhou and 160 subjects (63 men, 97 women, aged 29.1 ± 6.4 years) from Nanjing were enrolled.
TN|PMC5134814_S79|NEG|NEG|There was no difference between these 2 RIs, as determined by either the Mann–Whitney U test using the original Tg value (P = 0.304), or by the t test using the transformed Tg value (P = 0.336).
TN|PMC5134814_S9|NEG|NEG|No significant differences in Tg were found between genders or among different reference groups.
TN|PMC5134815_S112|NEG|NEG|In this study, maxillary or anterior teeth remained longer than did mandibular or posterior teeth.
TN|PMC5134815_S120|NEG|NEG|The present study also showed that almost 87% of adults brushed their teeth more than twice daily.
TN|PMC5134815_S140|NEG|NEG|The present study had several limitations.
TP|PMC5134815_S141|POS|POS|The first is that this study was based on a cross-sectional survey; it is thus difficult to demonstrate a causal relationship between oral health behavior, sociodemographic variables, and the number of remaining teeth based on the study.
TP|PMC5134815_S142|POS|POS|Second, this study was performed in only 1 Asian country.
TP|PMC5134815_S143|POS|POS|Multicenter and longitudinal cohort studies are required to ensure the high-level reliability of the results.
FP|PMC5134815_S144|POS|NEG|This study also has some strengths, though.
FP|PMC5134815_S145|POS|NEG|This study analyzed a representative sample of the entire Korean adult population, and to the best of our knowledge, this is the first report to investigate number of remaining teeth among the administrative districts of South Korea.
FP|PMC5134815_S146|POS|NEG|Moreover, this study revealed that location of remaining teeth had pattern according to socioeconomic status.
FP|PMC5134815_S147|POS|NEG|This study also investigated the timing of tooth brushing in detail, from before breakfast to before bedtime.
TN|PMC5134815_S23|NEG|NEG|Also, there was a significant decrease in all-cause mortality by 4% per tooth loss.
TN|PMC5134815_S26|NEG|NEG|Two mechanisms have been suggested for the influence of tooth loss on general health or mortality: inflammation and malnutrition.[6–8]
TN|PMC5134815_S30|NEG|NEG|Poor dentition attenuates mastication efficiency and causes subsequent self-limiting food selection with a diet devoid of fruits, vegetables, and other foods containing key nutrients.
TN|PMC5134815_S47|NEG|NEG|The Institutional Review Board of the Korean Center for Disease Control and Prevention approved this study (2008-04EXP-01-C, 2009-01CON-03-2C, and 2010-02CON-21-C), and it was accomplished according to the Helsinki Declaration's Ethical Principles for Medical Research Involving Human Subjects.
TN|PMC5134815_S6|NEG|NEG|The data were taken from the 2012–2012 Korea National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey.
TN|PMC5134815_S71|NEG|NEG|The frequency of daily tooth brushing was defined as the mean number of times brushing the teeth in a day.
TP|PMC5134816_S186|POS|POS|This study is a pivotal study, conducted in relatively small cohort of CKD patients; therefore, a larger population is requested to confirm our results.
TP|PMC5134816_S187|POS|POS|Also, all patients were on therapies with calcium, calcitriol, and phosphate binders and their treatments could have confounded the results.
TP|PMC5134816_S188|POS|POS|It seems that future large-scale studies are needed to clarify these differences.
TN|PMC5134816_S53|NEG|NEG|1,25-Dihydroxyvitamin D3 (1,25-(OH)2D3) (ng/mL) was measured by radioimmunoassay.
TN|PMC5134816_S81|NEG|NEG|The Minnesota multiphasic personality inventory-2 (MMPI-2): a standardized psychometric test of adult personality and psychopathology.
TN|PMC5134816_S85|NEG|NEG|This cut-off score indicates distinct psychological problems or pathology.
TN|PMC5134818_S102|NEG|NEG|Because of the common pathogenic process of the 2 disease entities and heterogeneous distribution of emphysema in the lungs, it has been postulated that regional severity of emphysema may determine the location of lung cancer.
TN|PMC5134818_S111|NEG|NEG|However, lobar distribution of emphysema is significantly different from the distribution between the upper and lower halves of the lungs divided by a transverse plane.
TN|PMC5134818_S118|NEG|NEG|In their study, the population was skewed toward lower percentage values of emphysema.
TN|PMC5134818_S122|NEG|NEG|Our results are in agreement with previous studies.[21–23]
TN|PMC5134818_S126|NEG|NEG|The odds of lung cancer in the lobes with more severe emphysema (lobar emphysema ratio ranked 1st or 2nd) was 2.48 than the other lobes with less severe emphysema (lobar emphysema ratio ranked 3rd, 4th, or 5th), which was higher than the odds of lung cancer according to lobar location.
TN|PMC5134818_S13|NEG|NEG|While cigarette smoking is a major risk factor for lung cancer, other factors such as family history of lung cancer, prior diagnosis of malignant tumor, occupational exposure to asbestos, and pre-existing lung disease such as chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) can also increase the risk of lung cancer.[1,2]
TN|PMC5134818_S131|NEG|NEG|This study had several limitations.
TP|PMC5134818_S132|POS|POS|First, the study population was relatively small and predominantly male.
TP|PMC5134818_S133|POS|POS|Results might be different in a larger population.
TP|PMC5134818_S134|POS|POS|Second, most patients with severe emphysema were not included in the study group because most of them had conditions (such as pneumonia, pleural effusion, and lung atelectasis) that might affect measurement of lung volume or emphysema.
TP|PMC5134818_S135|POS|POS|This might affect the statistical analysis.
TN|PMC5134818_S136|NEG|NEG|In a previous study, no dose–response effect of emphysema on the risk of lung cancer was found in patients with severe emphysema.[4]
TP|PMC5134818_S137|POS|POS|Thus, including patients with severe emphysema could weaken the relationship between lobar emphysema quantity and lung cancer.
TP|PMC5134818_S138|POS|POS|Third, we excluded patients with whole-lung emphysema ratios less than 1%.
TP|PMC5134818_S139|POS|POS|In addition, some patients were excluded following lobe segmentation failure due to technical reasons.
TP|PMC5134818_S140|POS|POS|These factors could act as a selection bias.
TP|PMC5134818_S141|POS|POS|Fourth, we did not analyze subjects according to specific types of lung cancer.
FN|PMC5134818_S142|NEG|POS|It is possible that some types of lung cancer are more likely to be affected by emphysema than other types.[26]
TN|PMC5134818_S16|NEG|NEG|However, studies to determine the relationship between quantitatively assessed emphysema and lung cancer have shown conflicting results[5–8]: Several studies performed on different lung cancer screening groups failed to show correlations between quantitative computed tomographic (CT) measurements of emphysema and lung cancer[5–7]; however, a recent study on a larger population of National Lung Cancer Screening Trial (NLST) showed a correlation between quantitative CT measures of emphysema and lung cancer risk.[8]
TN|PMC5134818_S24|NEG|NEG|The requirement for informed consent from patients was waived because this was a HIPA A compliant retrospective study.
TN|PMC5134818_S47|NEG|NEG|Borders of each lung, fissures, and central airways were detected automatically.
FN|PMC5134818_S60|NEG|POS|This was considered as a technical failure.
TN|PMC5134818_S85|NEG|NEG|The emphysema ratio in smokers and ex-smokers was significantly higher than that in never smokers (6.4 ± 5.1% vs 2.8 ± 1.6%, P = 0.002).
TN|PMC5134818_S87|NEG|NEG|The most frequent location of lung cancer was the left upper lobe (LUL, n = 28, 35.9%), followed by the right upper lobe (RUL, n = 27, 34.6%), left lower lobe (LLL, n = 13, 16.7%), right lower lobe (RLL, n = 9, 11.5%), and right middle lobe (RML, n = 1, 1.3%).
TN|PMC5134845_S105|NEG|NEG|Third, the T2 value in the IVD is known to be sensitive to water content and the composition of the collagen network structure.
TN|PMC5134845_S11|NEG|NEG|The nucleus pulposus (NP) values did not differ significantly between sexes at the same anatomic level (P > 0.05).
TN|PMC5134845_S68|NEG|NEG|In addition, boxplot and receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curves were generated.
TN|PMC5134845_S7|NEG|NEG|All discs were morphologically assessed based on the Pfirrmann grade, and regions of interests (ROIs) were drawn over the T2∗ mapping.
TN|PMC5134847_S102|NEG|NEG|In early periods, animal vaccines were made by cell cultivation in roller bottle.
TN|PMC5134847_S104|NEG|NEG|The numerous advantages of bioreactor mode include simple operation, high volumetric productivity, and low costs.[14]
TN|PMC5134847_S51|NEG|NEG|Particularly, AEs were collected for 72 hours following the first injection of rabies vaccines through telephone interview.
TN|PMC5134847_S90|NEG|NEG|Then, we compared respectively Vaccine B with Vaccines A, C, and D for children who were ≤5 years old.
TN|PMC5134848_S105|NEG|NEG|This model was used to generate risk-unadjusted and risk-adjusted funnel plots investigating the proportion of patients experiencing an optimal LOS across all the English colorectal MDTs managing these patients (Fig. 2A and B).
TN|PMC5134848_S21|NEG|NEG|The accepted “ideal” LOS resulting from optimal surgery and enhanced recovery programmes is deemed to be 5 days or fewer.
TN|PMC5134848_S25|NEG|NEG|Reliably identifying institutions with “outlying” practice is, however, difficult for several reasons.[6]
TN|PMC5134848_S3|NEG|NEG|The National Health Service (NHS) is facing financial constraints and thus there is considerable interest in ensuring the shortest but optimal hospital stays possible.
TN|PMC5134850_S127|NEG|NEG|This is considered supportive to our results as we found that hypomagnesemia is seen mainly in T1DM children with longer duration of diabetes.
TN|PMC5134850_S132|NEG|NEG|This agreed with Galli and Maggana [17] on Athens type I diabetic children that showed a lower Mg level in patients with poor glycemic control with high HbA1c.
TN|PMC5134850_S149|NEG|NEG|Guerrero-Romero and Rodríguez-Morán[37] showed that in patients with T2DM, hypomagnesemia is linked with low levels of HDL, irrespective of serum glucose level.
TN|PMC5134850_S158|NEG|NEG|This disagreement could be explained by different study populations between their studies and ours.
TN|PMC5134850_S166|NEG|NEG|We need to perform further studies on giving magnesium supplements in diabetic children with hypomagnesemia to observe the effect of correction of serum magnesium on glycemic control, lipid profile, and the risk of diabetic complications.
TN|PMC5134850_S169|NEG|NEG|Several limitations of this study deserve mentioning.
TP|PMC5134850_S170|POS|POS|First, we did not measure erythrocyte magnesium content.
TP|PMC5134850_S171|POS|POS|As magnesium is a predominantly intracellular ion, its serum measurements are not representative of magnesium status or intracellular pool.
TN|PMC5134850_S172|NEG|NEG|In this regard, significant intracellular magnesium depletion could be seen with normal serum concentrations[39]; however, because we already having a higher percentage of hypomagnesaemia in serum of our diabetic patients compared to our control subjects, this potential limitation did not influence our objective and conclusions.
TP|PMC5134850_S173|POS|POS|Second we did not randomize our patients, instead, we took all patients coming consecutively to our outpatient Endocrinology unit.
TN|PMC5134850_S174|NEG|NEG|However, because we have a good number of patients with age and sex matched control, this potential limitation did not influence our objective and conclusions.
TP|PMC5134850_S175|POS|POS|We recommend performing further multicenter studies on different populations with different levels of glycemic control in order to get more accurate results regarding the relationship between serum and intracellular magnesium in children with type 1Diabetes.
TN|PMC5134850_S4|NEG|NEG|This deficit could be associated with the development of late diabetic complications, especially macroangiopathy.
TN|PMC5134850_S61|NEG|NEG|Children with persistent diarrhea and vomiting.
TN|PMC5134851_S137|NEG|NEG|Propaganda needs of patients focused on 11 kinds of ways (Fig. 1), in which a higher proportion of opinions such as “hospital site,” “Doctor's personal blog, we-chat” and other comments were easy to implement as medical institutions and individual doctors.
TN|PMC5134851_S146|NEG|NEG|Different with health insurance in other countries, ATR-related health care costs will be borne entirely by the patients themselves, in China.
TN|PMC5134851_S158|NEG|NEG|Therefore, we need to conduct large-scale and multicenter clinical studies to provide a reference for Chinese patients.
TN|PMC5134851_S22|NEG|NEG|Freezing technology also retains the possibility of offspring for patients receiving chemotherapy or radiotherapy.
TN|PMC5134852_S49|NEG|NEG|Omental metastasis was also recognized as PD.
TN|PMC5134852_S58|NEG|NEG|Peripheral blood samples obtained preoperatively for measurement of CEA and CA125 concentrations were sent within 30 days before surgery to the Department of Nuclear Medicine of this hospital.
TN|PMC5134852_S66|NEG|NEG|A P value < 0.05 was considered to be significant.
TN|PMC5134852_S92|NEG|NEG|By contrast, CEA concentration did not differ according to grade.
TN|PMC5134853_S19|NEG|NEG|DM is classified into 4 categories: type 1 diabetes (destruction of pancreatic β-cells leading to insulin deficiency), type 2 diabetes (progressive insulin secretory defect), gestational diabetes (during pregnancy), and specific types of diabetes (due to other causes).[1,2]
TN|PMC5134853_S27|NEG|NEG|Other studies, however, did not reveal any differences in unstimulated and stimulated salivary flow rate in patients with type 1 diabetes[17,18] and unstimulated salivary flow rate in patients with type 2 diabetes.[15,19,20]
TN|PMC5134853_S28|NEG|NEG|Numerous salivary components have been studied in relation to DM, to its duration, and metabolic control.
TN|PMC5134853_S49|NEG|NEG|ALT and AST are involved in protein metabolism by transferring amine groups from amino acids to alpha-keto acids.
TN|PMC5134854_S19|NEG|NEG|Cardiac manifestations are very diverse but coronary vasospasm is uncommon.
TN|PMC5134854_S23|NEG|NEG|To our knowledge, this is the first case describing acute coronary vasospasm leading to cardiac arrest during corticosteroid interruption and following NSAID administration in EGPA.
TN|PMC5134854_S44|NEG|NEG|Corticosteroid therapy was stopped 12 days before as the patient was out of medication.
TN|PMC5134854_S92|NEG|NEG|Moreover, corticosteroid compliance must be emphasized among patients who display EGPA with high cardiac risk to prevent fatal issues.
TN|PMC5134855_S167|NEG|NEG|The G3 group thus provides an enriched group of patients for further investigation of the underlying mechanism of microvascular invasion and eventually, for therapeutic clinical trials.
TN|PMC5134855_S44|NEG|NEG|G3 was associated with overexpression of genes encoding proteins implicated in nucleus import/export, and overexpression of genes controlling the cell cycle and cell cycle checkpoints.
TN|PMC5134855_S75|NEG|NEG|Additional clinical–pathological variables available for all patients from Singapore were tumor burden as defined by the Milan criteria (single HCC ≤5 m, or ≤3 lesions each ≤3 cm, no macrovascular invasion, no distant metastasis) and the presence or absence or microvascular invasion.
TN|PMC5134855_S76|NEG|NEG|Test results for the European and Singapore analyses were compared for agreement based on P values and significance level.
TN|PMC5134856_S22|NEG|NEG|A complete unilateral failure of formation creates a hemivertebra, which may cause a wedge-shaped deformities during further growth.[2–6]
TN|PMC5134856_S23|NEG|NEG|Even though many cases of hemivertebra do not require early surgical treatment, instrumented posterior spinal fusion is one of the surgical treatments for congenital scoliosis at a young age.
TN|PMC5134856_S4|NEG|NEG|Congenital scoliosis due to a hemivertebra creates a wedge-shaped deformity, which progresses and causes severe spinal deformities as an individual grows.
TN|PMC5134856_S40|NEG|NEG|At the age of 4 years, the patient underwent posterior fusion with pedicle screw fixation to correct the deformity with convex side compression, from T10 to T12 (Fig. 1B), without hemivertebra resection or anterior and posterior epiphysiodesis.
TN|PMC5134858_S20|NEG|NEG|Long-term patient survival of individuals with NPSLE has strongly improved over the past decades, but involvement of the central nervous system (CNS) is one of the major causes of morbidity and mortality in patients with SLE.[6]
TN|PMC5134858_S43|NEG|NEG|This study was also carried out with the approval of the Regional Ethics Committee Caen (Northwest 3).
TN|PMC5134858_S87|NEG|NEG|Thus, many studies have focused on serological exploration of psychiatric patients, especially through antinuclear antibody screening.
TN|PMC5134858_S96|NEG|NEG|At first sight have included 100 patients could not seem to be enough because prevalence of SLE is rare but prevalence of SLE in young women is higher and prevalence of SLE in patients hospitalized for psychiatric symptom is not known but might be higher than in general population.
TN|PMC5134859_S10|NEG|NEG|It may attribute to low baseline viral loads and extraordinarily rapid suppression of HCV after treatment day1.
TN|PMC5134859_S28|NEG|NEG|The sonography revealed heterogeneous liver parenchyma without splenomegaly and visible collateral vessels.
TN|PMC5134859_S39|NEG|NEG|The institutional review board in Kaohsiung Medical University Hospital approved the survey.
TN|PMC5134859_S5|NEG|NEG|Twelve weeks of paritaprevir/ritonavir/ombitasvir plus dasabuvir (PROD) with or without ribavirin has shown to have a sustained virological response at post-treatment 12 weeks (SVR12) rate of >90% in HCV genotype 1 (HCV-1) patients.
TN|PMC5134860_S26|NEG|NEG|Abdominal compartment syndrome (ACS) is a well-documented complication which leads to multiple organ failure and postoperative death in rAAA patients undergoing open repair.
TN|PMC5134860_S39|NEG|NEG|ECG (electrocardiogram) monitoring was performed and oxygen was immediately given.
TN|PMC5134860_S72|NEG|NEG|Abdominal laparotomy was performed immediately to detect the reason for change in condition.
TN|PMC5134860_S8|NEG|NEG|An elderly man, 81 years old, complained a sudden lower abdominal and back pain without any predisposing cause.
TN|PMC5134861_S135|NEG|NEG|In endoscopy-negative IDA in patients over the age of 65 years, further investigations should be reserved for patients with persistent anemia, and second-look GI endoscopy should be favored in this situation.
TN|PMC5134861_S43|NEG|NEG|The investigations performed after the first standard endoscopic procedure and their delays were registered (termed “early further investigations” when performed in the first 3 months following inclusion and “follow-up investigations” when delayed) as were the diagnoses of IDA and modifications of therapy.
TN|PMC5134861_S91|NEG|NEG|Although the mortality rate was significantly higher in the patients who underwent further evaluations during follow-up, there was no direct complication of the further investigations that led to death.
TN|PMC5134861_S96|NEG|NEG|Among the 50 patients with no conventional causal IDA diagnoses, 80% (n = 40) received daily antithrombotics, 74% (n = 37) had an association of antithrombotics with minimal lesions.
TN|PMC5134862_S113|NEG|NEG|This is the first study in a Mexican population that shows the cost patients with POAG spend on their treatment in an ophthalmologic hospital.
TN|PMC5134862_S26|NEG|NEG|However, it has been observed that developing nations are disproportionately burdened with blindness, with a resulting decrease in productivity and care costs, further limiting the economic resources of these societies.[15]
TN|PMC5134862_S57|NEG|NEG|The files of 462 patients with registered continuous follow-ups from 2007 to 2012 were reviewed.
TN|PMC5134862_S72|NEG|NEG|This is the first study in Mexican population that shows how much the patients with glaucoma spend in their glaucoma treatment.
TN|PMC5134864_S24|NEG|NEG|Osteoid osteoma is a benign bone lesion with high incidence at the age between 10 and 20,[1] contributing to approximately 12% of benign skeletal neoplasms.
TN|PMC5134864_S27|NEG|NEG|After correcting the diagnosis, we successfully conducted posterior tumor resection, grafting bone fusion, and internal fixation.
TN|PMC5134864_S51|NEG|NEG|After necessary preoperative examinations, posterior lesion resection was conducted (Fig. 6).
TN|PMC5134864_S53|NEG|NEG|The result showed bone tissue with reticular structure, composited with bone tissue, osteoid tissue and new bone tissue.
TN|PMC5134865_S113|NEG|NEG|From a socio-economic perspective, the Korean National Health Service does not reimburse costs for diabetes self-management education or home supplies, such as lancets, needles, and blood glucose test strips and this barrier may hinder diabetic patients from performing SMBG or receiving diabetes self-management training.
TN|PMC5134865_S137|NEG|NEG|This study had several limitations.
TP|PMC5134865_S138|POS|POS|First, this was a case–control study in which the subjects were enrolled from a single tertiary center, which may have resulted in selection bias, and thus the results may not be generalizable to all patients with diabetes.
TP|PMC5134865_S139|POS|POS|Although we adjusted for a wide range of variables to identify risk factors for HMA in 2 groups that were comparable in terms of age, sex, and duration of diagnosed diabetes, the results may still be confounded by unmeasured factors.
TP|PMC5134865_S140|POS|POS|Second, because we designated the NSH group as patients with documented hypoglycemia, this group might include more individuals diagnosed via SMBG compared with the HMA group.
TP|PMC5134865_S141|POS|POS|Some of the patients with sequelae due to severe hypoglycemia did not revisit the hospital following their discharge, and thus, their long-term sequelae could not be evaluated.
TP|PMC5134865_S142|POS|POS|Finally, we defined HMA using only visits to ED due to hypoglycemia, and therefore, more severe cases that resulted in death before hospital visitation might have been missed.
TN|PMC5134865_S145|NEG|NEG|Previous episodes of severe hypoglycemia and absence of SMBG were independent risk factors of HMA.
TN|PMC5134865_S24|NEG|NEG|Severe hypoglycemia is defined as a state of low blood glucose that requires the assistance of another person[9] and this condition can lead to emergency department (ED) visits and often results in hospitalizations that incur substantial medical costs.[10]
TN|PMC5134865_S31|NEG|NEG|We also determined the predictors of severe hypoglycemia with neurological sequelae.
TN|PMC5134865_S55|NEG|NEG|All data were analyzed using the SPSS statistical software package (version 22.0; SPSS Inc.; Chicago, IL) and the R software packages (R version 3.1.2; R Foundation for Statistical Computing; Vienna, Austria; http://www.R-project.org/).
TN|PMC5134865_S85|NEG|NEG|In addition, patients with sequelae were hospitalized for longer periods of time, had a higher mRS score at discharge, and were more likely to be discharged to a facility or nursing home (11.3 days vs 5.0 days, P = 0.049; 2.9 vs 0.2, P < 0.001; 27% vs 8%, P = 0.068, respectively).
TN|PMC5134866_S134|NEG|NEG|Although resort to surgery, the concept of damage control surgery should also be kept in mind for the reason that long and traumatic surgery would be a disaster for the intra-abdominal bleeding patients with ECF.[32]
TN|PMC5134866_S19|NEG|NEG|Although the morbidity of ECF is low, the mortality is comparatively high, and the managements are extremely difficult.[5]
TN|PMC5134866_S39|NEG|NEG|One hundred and thirty-four ECF patients met the criteria and were matched as a control, with a ratio of 2:1.
TN|PMC5134866_S57|NEG|NEG|The statistical analysis was performed using SPSS 20.0 statistical software (IBM Analytics, Armonk, NY).
TN|PMC5134867_S10|NEG|NEG|Interestingly, the serial MRI examination (4 MRI scans over a period of 9 years) showed a “relapsing–remitting” pattern of brain lesions akin to that observed in a subtype of multiple sclerosis.
TN|PMC5134867_S32|NEG|NEG|A 41-year-old woman was referred to our department because of recurrent tonic-clonic seizures.
TN|PMC5134867_S53|NEG|NEG|The first MRI scan performed at the time of the first seizure episode showed multiple white matter lesions in the left frontal lobe and the parieto-occipital area; some lesions were enhanced after the gadolinium contrast injection (the MRI was lost).
TN|PMC5134867_S80|NEG|NEG|After excluding the possibility of brain tumor and vascular malformations by MR spectroscopy and DSA analysis, we think the enhancement of lesions might be related to vasculitis.
TN|PMC5134868_S109|NEG|NEG|TUDCA is available on the market in these countries: Italy, Turkey, and China.
TN|PMC5134868_S112|NEG|NEG|This more profound shift toward a more hydrophilic bile acid pool by administrating TUDCA may be more favorable, leading to more efficient extraction of taurine-conjugated bile acids.[8,17]
TN|PMC5134868_S32|NEG|NEG|Eligible patients were Chinese males or females with PBC, aged 18 to 70 years.
TN|PMC5134868_S82|NEG|NEG|As the primary efficacy endpoint, 76% of patients in the TUDCA group and 81% of patients in the UDCA group achieved a serum ALP reduction greater than 25% from baseline level following 24 weeks of treatment (P = 0.453).
TN|PMC5134869_S114|NEG|NEG|Clinical efficacy of the combination therapy was more potent than paclitaxel used alone with a 29% increase in the rate in the investigated population.
TN|PMC5134869_S140|NEG|NEG|There was a statistical difference in the observation between these 2 treatments (P < 0.01).
TN|PMC5134869_S146|NEG|NEG|There were statistical differences in these measurements between either before and after treatment of Avastin or after the 2 treatment approaches (both P < 0.01).
TN|PMC5134869_S69|NEG|NEG|The decrease is primarily attributed to drug metabolism and excretion.
TN|PMC5134870_S12|NEG|NEG|We concluded that humoral, nonspecific immunity (phagocytic activity and oxidative burst), and the IL-6 are influenced in patients with iron deficiency anemia.
TN|PMC5134870_S29|NEG|NEG|We aimed not only to evaluate the effect of iron deficiency anemia on humoral, cellular, nonspecific immunity but also the effect on the cytokines that are the key factors of many immunologic steps.
TN|PMC5134870_S7|NEG|NEG|We aimed to evaluate the effect of iron deficiency anemia on humoral, cellular, nonspecific immunity, and also the effect on the cytokines that are the key factors of many immunologic steps.
TN|PMC5134870_S81|NEG|NEG|P values ≤0.05 qualify as significant results and those ≤0.001 as highly significant results.
TN|PMC5134871_S101|NEG|NEG|The value of cyclin A immunohistochemistry to predict neoplastic progression was estimated in loglinear regression models.
TN|PMC5134871_S149|NEG|NEG|The biomarkers cyclin A and AMACR only showed a minimal drop or no drop in AUC after exclusion (cyclin A: 0.003 and AMACR: 0.0).
TN|PMC5134871_S153|NEG|NEG|In this large case–control study we evaluated the value of cyclin A expression for predicting neoplastic progression in patients with BE.
TN|PMC5134871_S160|NEG|NEG|Previous studies demonstrated repeatedly the value of LGD as a risk factor for neoplastic progression, albeit with a low predictive value due to sampling error and considerable interobserver variation.[4,6,12–15]
TN|PMC5134871_S187|NEG|NEG|Our study also has some limitations.
TP|PMC5134871_S188|POS|POS|Although immunohistochemistry is an established clinical examination method and easily applicable to standard clinical pathological laboratories, the scoring of the expression is a subjective assessment.
TP|PMC5134871_S189|POS|POS|It will require standardization of processing and scoring for reliable routine clinical application.
TN|PMC5134871_S190|NEG|NEG|In spite of this, our previous studies have shown good interobserver agreement for both p53 and SOX2 and they were relatively simple and straightforward to interpret.[17,18]
TP|PMC5134871_S191|POS|POS|Further validation of this panel of biomarkers in large prospective studies is required to confirm our findings.
TP|PMC5134871_S192|POS|POS|Secondly, as all patients with BE, the patients considered as controls in this study still have the potential to progress to HGD or EAC during the future follow-up.
FN|PMC5134871_S193|NEG|POS|However, since their median follow-up time was 6.5 years (which is more the twice the follow-up time of the cases), and the incidence of progression in only 2.6/1000 patients per year, the chance of progression in the controls is slim.[6]
TN|PMC5134871_S46|NEG|NEG|According to standard procedure, all biopsy samples were fixated with buffered formalin and embedded in paraffin.
TN|PMC5134871_S71|NEG|NEG|A negative control was obtained by omission of the primary antibody.
TN|PMC5134871_S85|NEG|NEG|When there was disagreement between the 2 investigators, slides were reviewed by an experienced academic pathologist (KB or MD) and final diagnosis was made if 2 investigators agreed on the extend of cyclin A expression.
TN|PMC5134872_S109|NEG|NEG|In this study, women aged 50 years or younger who had PID had a higher risk of developing secondary primary malignancies than older women.
TN|PMC5134872_S111|NEG|NEG|Manavi[20] reported that women between 16 and 19 years of age had the highest prevalence of chlamydial infection, and a proportion of these women eventually developed PID.
TN|PMC5134872_S124|NEG|NEG|Our study had several limitations.
TP|PMC5134872_S125|POS|POS|First, the database does not contain information regarding the classification and severity of PID.
TN|PMC5134872_S126|NEG|NEG|However, the NHI covered approximately 97% of the island's population, and we could verify PID episodes.
FP|PMC5134872_S127|POS|NEG|The trend identified in the study should not have been affected by the missing information.
TP|PMC5134872_S128|POS|POS|Second, almost all patients diagnosed as PID would receive treatments in Taiwan, because most residents in Taiwan are covered by NHI program and the treatment fee is free.
TP|PMC5134872_S129|POS|POS|Therefore, it could not differentiate whether no treatment of PID would further increase the risk of secondary malignancy in this study.
TP|PMC5134872_S130|POS|POS|Third, HPV is a cause of cervical cancer, vaginal cancer, vulva cancer and should be incorporated into this secondary malignancy study.
FN|PMC5134872_S131|NEG|POS|However, there is no data about HPV vaccination in our NHIRD database because HPV vaccination is still self-paid, not covered by NHI and is therefore not included in NHIRD.
TN|PMC5134872_S132|NEG|NEG|However, HPV prevalence is relatively low in Asia compared to that in non-Asian areas (11–19% vs 57–75%).[26,27]
TP|PMC5134872_S133|POS|POS|The importance of HPV infection was likely reduced in our cohort.
TN|PMC5134872_S134|NEG|NEG|Fourth, tobacco use might be a risk factor for secondary primary cancers.[28]
TP|PMC5134872_S135|POS|POS|The database does not contain this information.
TN|PMC5134872_S136|NEG|NEG|However, tobacco use is correlated with chronic obstructive pulmonary disease.
TP|PMC5134872_S137|POS|POS|We used chronic obstructive pulmonary disease instead of tobacco use for adjustment.
FP|PMC5134872_S138|POS|NEG|Taken together and given the robustness of both the evidence and statistical analyses used in this study, these limitations are unlikely to have compromised our results.
TN|PMC5134872_S18|NEG|NEG|In conclusion, the incidence of second primary cancers was higher in the genitals, bladder, and colon in patients with cervical cancer treated with surgery alone.
TN|PMC5134872_S31|NEG|NEG|For surgery, secondary primary cancer is not being considered as a substantial long-term clinical complication of cancer surgery, except in some breast, colon, and stomach cancer survivors, such as angiosarcoma in a lymphedema arm postaxillary lymph node dissection in breast cancers patients.[9]
TN|PMC5134872_S39|NEG|NEG|This study was approved by the Institutional Review Board of Buddhist Dalin Tzu Chi General Hospital, and the approval number is B10001017.
TN|PMC5134872_S4|NEG|NEG|The high-risk area of second primary cancers in cervical cancer survivors is the pelvis.
TN|PMC5134872_S52|NEG|NEG|To exclude the effect on second primary malignancy by treatment modalities, all cervical patients who ever having received adjuvant or definite radiotherapy or chemotherapy for primary cervical cancer were excluded (Fig. 1).
TN|PMC5134872_S56|NEG|NEG|This cervical cancer cohort treated by surgery alone was divided into PID and non-PID groups.
TN|PMC5134872_S68|NEG|NEG|According to this formula, we could obtain standardized rate numbers of cases for different cancers and years.
TN|PMC5134872_S7|NEG|NEG|Between 2000 and 2010, a total of 24,444 cervical cancer patients were identified using the Registry Data for Catastrophic Illness and the National Health Insurance Research Database (NHIRD) of Taiwan.
TN|PMC5134872_S77|NEG|NEG|A Cox proportional hazard regression model was used to calculate the adjusted risk after adjusting for confounders.
TN|PMC5134872_S78|NEG|NEG|P < 0.05 was defined as statistically significant.
TN|PMC5134872_S84|NEG|NEG|The characteristics and comorbidities of the patients included in the study are shown in Table 1.
TN|PMC5134872_S86|NEG|NEG|Higher frequencies of second primary cancers were observed in the genitals, bladder, and colon.
TN|PMC5134872_S89|NEG|NEG|The 6-year cumulative risk of second primary cancers is 0.16% and 0.12% for PID and without PID, respectively.
TN|PMC5134873_S43|NEG|NEG|Using the age-classified normal ECD database as the reference, eZIS has become the most widely used software for analysis of Tc-99m ECD brain SPECT in Japan.[8,9]
TN|PMC5134873_S51|NEG|NEG|In addition to the anatomy-oriented imaging modality of MRI, the findings of SS on functional imaging, such as positron emission tomography (PET) and SPECT, had ever been rarely reported.
TN|PMC5134873_S58|NEG|NEG|Waragai et al[15] found a specific hypoperfusion pattern on eZIS analysis of SPECT in the cerebellum and pons in patients with multiple system atrophy and in the cerebellum in cortical cerebellar atrophy (CCA).
TN|PMC5134873_S63|NEG|NEG|As an objectively software-assisted tool for ECD images, more clinical experiences are still needed to confirm the incremental value of eZIS in enhancing the diagnosis of neurological diseases.
TN|PMC5134874_S109|NEG|NEG|In HCC therapy, how to treat large tumor or PVTT and how much margin is safe to prevent reoccurrence are always in great debate.
TN|PMC5134874_S126|NEG|NEG|The present study has its limitations.
TP|PMC5134874_S127|POS|POS|First of all, the sample size was small.
TP|PMC5134874_S128|POS|POS|Second, there was no control group to compare with.
FP|PMC5134874_S129|POS|NEG|A prospective, multicenter, randomized controlled trial comparing focal and segment ablation is now ongoing in China (Trial Registry Number, ChiCTR-TRC-12002786).
TN|PMC5134874_S137|NEG|NEG|Advances in knowledge:1.Segment ablation could be a safe and effective treatment strategy to treat advanced HCC patients.2
TN|PMC5134874_S138|NEG|NEG|.Minimally invasive percutaneous ablation therapy could be successfully used to treat advanced stage HCC with portal vein tumor thrombosis.3
TN|PMC5134874_S25|NEG|NEG|However, recurrence of patients with a tumor ≥50 mm was high after ablation.[9–12]
TN|PMC5134875_S26|NEG|NEG|However, there have been no previous reports of Halomonas infection in ESRD patients on CAPD.

TN|PMC5134875_S74|NEG|NEG|They had previously reported the treatment of Halomonas-infected hemodialysis patients.
TN|PMC5134876_S112|NEG|NEG|Thus, the joint involvement pattern of early- and late-onset gout patients differs.
TN|PMC5134876_S119|NEG|NEG|In the present study, alcohol and high-purine food consumption were significant triggers in both groups, and compared with the late-onset patients, early-onset patients had a slightly but significantly higher proportion of having alcohol consumption, especially beer, as a gout trigger.
TN|PMC5134876_S141|NEG|NEG|This study had several limitations.
TP|PMC5134876_S142|POS|POS|First, this is a retrospective study and depends on patient-reported responses and therefore there may be misclassification bias, since patients with a longer disease duration tend to not recollect clearly the exact date of onset and frequency of flare in the first year, which might result in bias in our final results.
TP|PMC5134876_S143|POS|POS|Second, PUMCH is a general medical center, and patients presenting to our clinic usually had a more severe disease, which might have caused patient bias.
TP|PMC5134876_S144|POS|POS|Third, this is a cross-sectional study of an outpatient clinic, the sample size was small, and the rate of successful follow-up was relatively low.
TP|PMC5134876_S145|POS|POS|A well designed prospective study, such as one using national electrical medical records that could follow the entire disease course, would be helpful for further studies of the clinical and genetic characteristics of early- and late-onset gout patients.
TN|PMC5134876_S31|NEG|NEG|A retrospective observational study was conducted in patients presenting to the GOUT clinic of PUMCH from June 2008 to July 2014.
TN|PMC5134876_S84|NEG|NEG|After adjustment for disease onset age, disease duration, SUA level, sex, BMI, metabolic syndrome, and eGFR, the associations by age of disease onset were attenuated for both recent flare frequency (P = 0.085) and the cumulative number of joints involved (P = 0.473); while disease duration and SUA remained significantly associated with recent flare frequency and the cumulative number of joints involved (P = 0.011 to ∼<0.001) (Table 2).
TN|PMC5134876_S89|NEG|NEG|Among these patients, 60.3% reported alcohol intake and 69.6% reported high-purine food intake before their gout flare.
TN|PMC5134877_S160|NEG|NEG|Hematogeneous spread (n = 32, 22.5%), and lymphangitic spread (n = 21, 14.8%) were also observed.
TN|PMC5134877_S26|NEG|NEG|Contrast-enhanced computed tomography (CT) scans can be useful for the diagnosis and revealing the extent of mediastinal invasion.
TN|PMC5134877_S89|NEG|NEG|The tumors were located in the peripheral (n = 8) and subpleural zones (n = 13) of the lung: right upper lobe (n = 8), right middle lobe (n = 1), right lower lobe (n = 5), and left upper lobe (n = 7).
TN|PMC5134877_S92|NEG|NEG|A total of 120 patients (84.5%) had evidence of airway involvement (Table 2); 52 (43.4%) had single bronchial involvement and the remaining 68 (56.6%) had 2 or more bronchial involvement.

TN|PMC5134879_S10|NEG|NEG|Interleukin-17A protein and mRNA levels in the nasal tissues of smokers were greater compared to those in the nasal tissues of nonsmokers (P = 0.02 both) and control patients (P = 0.05 and 0.04, respectively).
TN|PMC5134879_S3|NEG|NEG|Cigarette smoke plays a substantial role in the development of airway inflammatory diseases, including asthma and chronic rhinosinusitis (CRS).
TN|PMC5134879_S53|NEG|NEG|Antibody labeling was visualized using the avidin–biotin complex method (LSAB 2 kit; DAKO, CA and DAB peroxidase substrate kit; Vector Laboratories, CA).
TN|PMC5134879_S92|NEG|NEG|The mRNA expression levels of IL-17A were not correlated with the sinus subjective SNOT-22 scores (Fig. 3A), objective CT scores for evaluation of CRS (Fig. 3B),or subjective ACT scores for asthma control (Fig. 3C); however, they were well correlated with the predicted FEV1/FVC ratio in the pulmonary function test (Fig. 3D).
TN|PMC5134880_S26|NEG|NEG|The famous studies, diabetes control and complications trial and UK prospective diabetes study, have confirmed the advantages and risks from strict blood glucose control.[4–6]
TN|PMC5134880_S5|NEG|NEG|This study explored the objective existence of “dusk phenomenon” (spontaneous and transient predinner hyperglycemia) and its clinical significance.
TN|PMC5134880_S58|NEG|NEG|In T2DM patients, during insulin pump therapy, the patients whose differences between predinner and postlunch blood glucose levels were all 0 mmol/L or more, were enrolled in dusk phenomenon group.
TN|PMC5134880_S89|NEG|NEG|There were statistical differences in prebreakfast, postbreakfast 2 hour, prelunch, postlunch 2 hour, predinner, postdinner 2 hour, and prebed blood glucose levels among the 3 groups (all P < 0.05); especially, predinner blood glucose level was significantly higher in dusk phenomenon group than in suspicious group and nondusk phenomenon group (all P < 0.05).
TN|PMC5134881_S145|NEG|NEG|However, the other 4 drugs have not been reported in management of diabetic neuropathy.
TN|PMC5134881_S152|NEG|NEG|The genes might be recommended as possible biomarkers for progression of diabetic neuropathy.
TN|PMC5134881_S62|NEG|NEG|At least 30 genes were required for each module.
TN|PMC5134881_S89|NEG|NEG|Total 749 DEGs were screened between nonprogressing diabetic neuropathy and progressing diabetic neuropathy samples, including 370 upregulated DEGs and 379 downregulated DEGs.

TN|PMC5134883_S11|NEG|NEG|Very old patients had more frequent distant metastases (5%) than the older (2%) and young groups (1%) (P < 0.001).
TN|PMC5134883_S117|NEG|NEG|In the present study, we demonstrated that advanced age is a significant prognostic factor in the risk of recurrence and DFS for PTC.
TN|PMC5134883_S142|NEG|NEG|Previous studies [15,16] focusing on elderly patients showed significantly longer overall survival for patients who underwent surgery than for those who did not.
TN|PMC5134883_S67|NEG|NEG|Qualitative data were represented as a percentage or frequency.
TN|PMC5134884_S109|NEG|NEG|CRP is an acute phase reaction protein synthesized in the liver and is considered as a good index for early diagnosis of inflammation.[16]
TN|PMC5134884_S136|NEG|NEG|Our study did not find the advantages of traditional inflammation markers for the differential diagnosis of CAP severity, which may be attributed to the reduction of bacterial infections in CAP and the complexity of pathogens.
TN|PMC5134884_S90|NEG|NEG|In recent years, MP has become most common cause of CAP in children.[8,9]
TN|PMC5134884_S97|NEG|NEG|In our study, the detection rate of MP was 27.4%, which was lower than 43.64% that reported by Shu, the reason might be attributed to the low average age of children in this study.
TN|PMC5134885_S20|NEG|NEG|Uric acid (UA) is the product of purine metabolism in the body.
TN|PMC5134885_S3|NEG|NEG|The aim of this study was to investigate the role of uric acid (UA) in assessing rectal cancer metastasis.
TN|PMC5134885_S63|NEG|NEG|Interesting, multivariate analysis model revealed that elevated serum levels of UA were significant prognostic marker for lymphatic metastasis in patients with rectal cancer, independently of CRP, CEA, and tumor diameter (odds ratio [OR] 1.035, 95% confidence interval [CI] 1.013–1.057, P = 0.002; Table 2).
TN|PMC5134885_S88|NEG|NEG|The study was approved by the Ethics Committee of The First College of Clinical Medical Science, China Three Gorges University and Yichang Central People's Hospital, and all patients provided informed consent.

TN|PMC5134886_S84|NEG|NEG|The main DTG associated adverse events reported in the DTG trials were diarrhea, nausea, headache, and naso-pharingitis.[1,2]
TN|PMC5134887_S104|NEG|NEG|However, it had no benefit for a CHADS2 score of 1 to 2.
TN|PMC5134887_S140|NEG|NEG|There were several limitations to this study.
TP|PMC5134887_S141|POS|POS|This was a retrospective study and not a randomized trial, and it carried all the limitations of such trials, despite this being a multicenter study.
TP|PMC5134887_S142|POS|POS|The data abstracted from the medical records were limited by the degree of the documentation.
TP|PMC5134887_S143|POS|POS|Hence, the indication for VKA treatment and the reason for an omission were ambiguous in some patients.
TP|PMC5134887_S144|POS|POS|Furthermore, the decision for a VKA prescription was dependent on the physician of each center, which could have influenced the consistency of our results.
TN|PMC5134887_S23|NEG|NEG|In this retrospective, multicenter study we evaluated the long-term safety and efficacy of VKA treatment in AF patients with previous ulcer bleeding.
TN|PMC5134887_S44|NEG|NEG|Among the 754 patients enrolled in this study, 458 (61%) were treated with VKA during the follow-up period.
TN|PMC5134887_S45|NEG|NEG|The intensity of the anticoagulation was determined by the INR values.

TN|PMC5134888_S135|NEG|NEG|In addition, the OCD has been correlated with 6MWD[13] and it has been used to predict oxyhemoglobin desaturation[24] and selection of the ramp slope for dyspneic patients.[15]
TN|PMC5134888_S137|NEG|NEG|Although the BDI contains the 3 domains of functional capability, and magnitudes of task and effort, all are related to activity or exercise intensity.[1]
TN|PMC5134888_S148|NEG|NEG|The SGRQ consists of 3 domains and 50 items, of which 24 are related to activity, exertion, and/or dyspnea[5] (16 are related to activity, and 8 in the impact domain are also related to activities, Supplement 4), so that the SGRQ is correlated with EDS, dyspnea intensity at rest, and 6MWD.
TN|PMC5134888_S153|NEG|NEG|The CAT score consists of only 8 items, with 2 regarding exertion[4] and 6 being related to symptom and impact domains.
TN|PMC5134888_S158|NEG|NEG|Therefore, the CAT may serve as a surrogate for the SGRQ[28] and may predict acute exacerbations.[8]
FN|PMC5134888_S169|NEG|POS|This is a cross-sectional study, so the temporal effect on the stability of the response of each tool is unknown despite good reported test-retest reliability.[1,28,34]

TN|PMC5136716_S132|NEG|NEG|We present a straightforward graphical method of predicting a patient's survival time from ALS diagnosis, taking into account the known prognostic factors of onset site, age at symptom onset, diagnostic delay, riluzole use, NIV use and respiratory muscle involvement.
TN|PMC5136716_S138|NEG|NEG|We give an explicit, straightforward method which can be applied in the clinic in moments, without specialised tests or detailed calculation.
TN|PMC5136716_S151|NEG|NEG|Since our statistical methods have not been used previously in this context, this provides a check on our methods and indirectly supports the novel findings of this study.
TP|PMC5136716_S153|POS|POS|Like any model, the present study represents a compromise between simplicity and robustness on the one hand, and the faithful representation of reality on the other.
FP|PMC5136716_S154|POS|NEG|There is evidence that patients with upper motor neuron features alone12 or lower motor neuron features alone12 22–24 tend to survive longer, and that those with cognitive impairment,25 neck weakness,26 weight loss at diagnosis6 and certain genotypes27 28 have a higher overall mortality.
TP|PMC5136716_S155|POS|POS|Our study did not include information on these factors.
TP|PMC5136716_S156|POS|POS|In constructing the model, we assumed that the patients did not have respiratory muscle involvement at diagnosis.
TP|PMC5136716_S157|POS|POS|This biases our model slightly towards predicting shorter survival in those without respiratory involvement.
TP|PMC5136716_S158|POS|POS|The basic assumption that respiratory involvement always occurs before death will also have exceptions.
FN|PMC5136716_S159|NEG|POS|The availability and use of gastrostomy and NIV may vary between centres, as well as other aspects of care relevant to survival.29
TP|PMC5136716_S160|POS|POS|The model does not take account of such variation.
TP|PMC5136716_S161|POS|POS|Although we tried to avoid bias by using a population-based cohort, one must always be cautious in applying a model to populations other than the one from which it was derived.
TP|PMC5136716_S162|POS|POS|The model is useful for predicting survival at the time of diagnosis, and once respiratory involvement has occurred; the prediction of survival at other times during a patient's illness is not addressed by the model.
TP|PMC5136716_S163|POS|POS|The present study is not a clinical trial, and therefore the effect of riluzole use should be interpreted cautiously as ‘those who receive riluzole survive longer’ rather than as ‘riluzole prolongs survival’, though both are consistent with the data.
TP|PMC5136716_S164|POS|POS|A weakness of this study is that the population studied has a lower median age of onset than is typical for population registers.
TP|PMC5136716_S165|POS|POS|This may reflect underascertainment of older age groups, which would be consistent with the lifetime risk curves previously reported.1 30
TP|PMC5136716_S166|POS|POS|It may alternatively reflect the influence of London, which is a large component of the catchment and being urban, has a younger population than average.
TP|PMC5136716_S167|POS|POS|A further weakness is that the risk curves have been derived in a population study but will be most likely applied in a clinic setting, and clinics have a generally younger, more male population, which may limit its applicability.
TN|PMC5136716_S21|NEG|NEG|The cause is not well understood; there is a significant genetic component, but only a minority of cases are due to single-gene mutations.2
TN|PMC5136716_S23|NEG|NEG|It is therefore difficult to advise a patient on how long they may expect to live, and on the uncertainty in this prediction, and not every patient wants detailed information; nonetheless, for many patients diagnosed with a life-limiting illness, such an estimate is important for providing hope and enabling them to plan their life and its ending, not to mention improving the design and interpretation of clinical trials.
TN|PMC5136716_S54|NEG|NEG|Using this model, we could ask whether the predictor variables (age at symptom onset, diagnostic delay, riluzole use) were associated with progression to respiratory muscle weakness, or separately with mortality after respiratory muscle involvement.
FN|PMC5136716_S61|NEG|POS|We were not able to estimate this survival benefit using our data, and estimates in the literature vary widely.
TN|PMC5136716_S62|NEG|NEG|The largest study is reported by Bourke et al,21 but the authors do not explicitly derive a figure for survival benefit.
TN|PMC5136716_S63|NEG|NEG|Fitting exponential distributions to their Kaplan-Meier plots suggests a 3.5-fold survival benefit for NIV (figure 2).
TN|PMC5136716_S64|NEG|NEG|On the basis of the clinic audit data, we estimated that 80% of our patients accessed NIV during their illness, and assumed this to be independent of the covariates.
TN|PMC5136716_S68|NEG|NEG|The effects of predictor variables on survival can be modelled in two ways: as affecting the chance of death occurring at any particular time (a Cox's proportional hazards model) or as affecting the length of time until death (an accelerated failure time (AFT) model).
FN|PMC5136716_S71|NEG|POS|The distribution of times from diagnosis to respiratory involvement could not be visualised directly, but only in the context of the combined model, so the choice of model distribution was arbitrary among those amenable to AFT analysis.
TN|PMC5136716_S78|NEG|NEG|The mean was the only parameter which was allowed to depend on the predictor variables of age at symptom onset, diagnostic delay (log transformed) and riluzole use.
TN|PMC5136716_S96|NEG|NEG|Table 2 shows summary statistics of the variables of interest in the patient groups.
TN|PMC5136717_S18|NEG|NEG|A major contributor to upper limb motor deficit is the initial severity of stroke, but a number of other factors appear to be important, not least of which is the infarct location.3
TN|PMC5136717_S3|NEG|NEG|Motor deficit after stroke is related to regional anatomical damage.
FN|PMC5136717_S44|NEG|POS|Note that statistical inferences for the weight maps were not feasible, as a weight map was acquired for each patient subgroup, not for each patient.
TN|PMC5136717_S48|NEG|NEG|Lesion likelihood maps for the two patient subgroups are shown in figure 1A, B.
TN|PMC5136719_S125|NEG|NEG|Binding to the ‘G’ (protective) allele was outcompeted by 100-fold excess of unlabelled ‘G’ (figure 3 and online supplementary figure S3A).
TN|PMC5136719_S130|NEG|NEG|Addition of TWIST1 antibody to the EMSA reduced/inhibited the formation of the DNA-protein complex for both alleles (figure 3).
TN|PMC5136719_S7|NEG|NEG|IL23R and IL12RB2 mRNA levels in CD4+ T cells were compared between cases homozygous for the AS-risk ‘A’ allele and the protective ‘G’ allele.
TN|PMC5136719_S86|NEG|NEG|H19 primers were purchased from Diagenode (Liege, Belgium).
TN|PMC5136726_S135|NEG|NEG|Involvement of the cerebellum in C9+ patients with ALS has been demonstrated by histological studies of C9orf72 pathology.23–26
TN|PMC5136726_S138|NEG|NEG|By offering an intermediate phenotype, neuroimaging might provide the link between factors underlying the pathological mechanisms resulting in particular patterns of neurodegeneration and clinical phenotypes.
TN|PMC5136726_S27|NEG|NEG|Patients were recruited from the outpatient clinic for motor neuron diseases at the University Medical Center Utrecht (UMC Utrecht).
TN|PMC5136726_S84|NEG|NEG|To investigate whether the ‘C9+’ neuroimaging phenotype was also present within the group of C9− patients with ALS, we subsequently applied the model to the remaining 128 C9− patients with ALS (who were not used to develop the model) to identify those with and without a ‘C9+’ neuroimaging phenotype.
TN|PMC5137302_S112|NEG|NEG|She has a predicted risk of 0.11% of developing a VTE within the first six weeks of delivery.
TN|PMC5137302_S115|NEG|NEG|She had a history of cardiac disease and varicose veins.
TN|PMC5137302_S117|NEG|NEG|Interpretation: if 1000 women with the same risk factors are followed, 49 will develop VTE within six weeks of childbirth.
TN|PMC5137302_S129|NEG|NEG|Table 1 summarises the basic characteristics of the study population.
TN|PMC5137302_S173|NEG|NEG|This is because venous thromboembolism is the leading cause of direct maternity mortality in the UK, and venous thromboembolism related death may be prevented through targeted thromboprophylaxis.
FN|PMC5137302_S180|NEG|POS|However, by excluding women with a history of venous thromboembolism from our study, we may have limited its effect on our estimates.
FN|PMC5137302_S181|NEG|POS|Furthermore, universal screening for some of those risk factors (such as factor V Leiden) is not routinely recommended in pregnant women, so pragmatically it cannot be used to predict the risk of first venous thromboembolism in the wider general population.
TN|PMC5137302_S182|NEG|NEG|The current RCOG thromboprophylaxis guideline recommends risk assessment for venous thromboembolism intrapartum or immediately after childbirth.5
TN|PMC5137302_S183|NEG|NEG|Thus our risk assessment tool can be used to quantify risk of venous thromboembolism during that period.
TN|PMC5137302_S184|NEG|NEG|However, our prediction model should not be used for women with one or more risk factors not measured in our model (for example, immobilisation due to fracture or in general) and should not be relied on to the exclusion of clinical judgment for prescribing thromboprophylaxis.
TP|PMC5137302_S185|POS|POS|We acknowledge that our model does not take into account disease severity for specific comorbidities owing to data limitations and inadequate number of venous thromboembolism events leading to a lack of power to stratify on disease severity, if known.
TN|PMC5137302_S186|NEG|NEG|However, our prediction model is in line with the existing guidelines that also do not take into account disease severity.
FP|PMC5137302_S187|POS|NEG|Women who become pregnant are generally healthier and have lower prevalence of pre-existing comorbidities compared with the general population.
FP|PMC5137302_S188|POS|NEG|In our study, the prevalence of heart, kidney, and inflammatory bowel disease was around 1% (even after use of our broad definitions).
TP|PMC5137302_S189|POS|POS|Thus the proportion of women experiencing severe heart and kidney disease during pregnancy will be even lower, and these women will probably be cared for very differently from those with well controlled comorbidities.
TP|PMC5137302_S190|POS|POS|We also believe that whereas in theory our model could be improved by ascertaining more detail on the severity of risk factors, this would negatively affect the ability to apply this in practice where information on risk factors will need to be obtained accurately in a relatively short clinical assessment.
TN|PMC5137302_S194|NEG|NEG|One was based on a weighted risk score for exposures associated with at least a fivefold increase in risk of venous thromboembolism6 34; the other, an individualised risk assessment tool, was based on absolute risks of venous thromboembolism.35
TN|PMC5137302_S199|NEG|NEG|These guidelines do not take into account the individualised absolute risk of venous thromboembolism based on women’s complex clinical risk profile, and nor have they been externally validated, which is crucial to facilitate their translation into practice.
TN|PMC5137302_S2|NEG|NEG|Objective To develop and validate a risk prediction model for venous thromboembolism in the first six weeks after delivery (early postpartum).
TN|PMC5137302_S211|NEG|NEG|Targeted thromboprophylaxis can prevent VTE, but clinical risk prediction of VTE in postpartum women is rudimentary
TN|PMC5137302_S22|NEG|NEG|A similar system is used in Sweden,6 which is more conservative than those in the UK and Canada.
TN|PMC5137302_S70|NEG|NEG|On the basis of an estimated 300 venous thromboembolism events during the first six weeks postpartum and 22 candidate predictors in our derivation cohort, we had an effective sample size of 14 venous thromboembolism events per predictor, above the minimum requirement suggested by Peduzzi et al.22
TN|PMC5139145_S17|NEG|NEG|While research into respiratory diseases has rewarded us with pharmacological treatments such as inhaled corticosteroids, leukotriene receptor antagonists, β agonists and more recently targeted monoclonal therapies which have helped alleviate the burden of asthma it is only since ca.
TN|PMC5139145_S180|NEG|NEG|While the role of the gut microbiota in shaping the mucosal immune system, the symbiosis between the gut microbiota and intestinal mucosa, and the importance of barrier function within the gut is well understood, there remains a paucity of information pertaining to the lung [11].
TN|PMC5139145_S49|NEG|NEG|The oral cavity and stomach contained high species richness and the highest bacterial signal levels in comparison to both the nasal cavity and lungs which had much lower bacterial signal levels.
TN|PMC5139145_S52|NEG|NEG|Unintentional environmental contamination when processing can lead to the unintentional identification of contaminants by the powerful sequencing technologies and controlling potential sources of contamination such as reagents is vital.
TN|PMC5141587_S27|NEG|NEG|Pregnant women, including up to two weeks post-partum
TN|PMC5141587_S34|NEG|NEG|In tropical and subtropical regions the seasonality of influenza is less well defined (fig 2).24 25
TN|PMC5141587_S36|NEG|NEG|As most people have no immunity to the new subtype, infection spreads quickly (table 2).
TN|PMC5141587_S96|NEG|NEG|During an outbreak, consider isolation of residents of closed settings for the duration of the infectious period (five days after symptom onset) to limit spread to others.
TN|PMC5141641_S100|NEG|NEG|The cell suspension was applied on a MACS separation column subjected to a magnetic field provided by the MACS separator.
TN|PMC5141641_S103|NEG|NEG|To gain high purity of AEC2s, collect T1α-negative cells, incubated with mouse anti-rat EpCAM antibodies (Abcam, USA) for 40 min at 4 °C, and then handle cells as above with rat anti-mouse MicroBead solution.
TN|PMC5141641_S23|NEG|NEG|Using a microfluidic magnetic activated cell sorting system, our previous study has isolated mouse lung multipotent stem cells (MLSCs) which play an important role in bronchiolar and alveolar epithelial cells injury repair [8].
TN|PMC5141641_S94|NEG|NEG|First, rat IgG panning to deplete immunocytes expressing FcR to enrich for alveolar epithelial cells.
TN|PMC5143210_S9|NEG|NEG|Of 4979 patients who met inclusion criteria, we identified 867 Local patients who traveled 2.7 [interquartile range (IQR): 1.6–4 miles] miles to centers that treated 2.6 (IQR: 1.9–3.3) esophageal cancers per year, and 317 Travel patients who traveled 107.1 (IQR: 65–247) miles to centers treating 31.9 (IQR: 30.9–38.5) cases.
TN|PMC5145251_S116|NEG|NEG|Following the FDA's postmarketing requirement for all US-approved GBCAs,22 we voluntarily initiated this study on gadobutrol adhering to the FDA's proposed study design.
TN|PMC5145251_S12|NEG|NEG|Overall, 184 patients (20.3%) underwent further contrast-enhanced MRI with other gadolinium-based contrast agents within the 2-year follow-up.
TN|PMC5145251_S146|NEG|NEG|Our results are in accordance with other reports on gadobutrol use in patients with renal impairment.
TN|PMC5145251_S84|NEG|NEG|On June 2, 2011, the FDA released the pharmaceutical companies manufacturing GBCAs from completing study enrollment but the full 2-year follow-up was required for all patients already enrolled.25
TN|PMC5145252_S114|NEG|NEG|A hyperintense rim with arterial contrast enhancement was visible in 7 cases around the 24 ablation zones and persisted for 3 months in 5 and for 6 months in 2 of the 7 cases.
TN|PMC5145252_S143|NEG|NEG|Since this was observed in all 34 cases with complete ablation, any increase in size of the ablation zone should rise the suspicion of local recurrence.
TN|PMC5145252_S150|NEG|NEG|Our study has a number of limitations.
TP|PMC5145252_S151|POS|POS|We dealt with a relatively small group of patients who have various tumor types with different histological aspects in their appearance and may have been treated with different types of systemic therapy before, which may influence the “treatment response,” and may, in principle, influence the MRI appearance of the liver.
TN|PMC5145252_S152|NEG|NEG|However, none of our patients exhibited signs of chemotherapy-associated steatohepatitis clinically or at MRI.
TP|PMC5145252_S153|POS|POS|Moreover, we did not investigate the effects of IRE on other imaging methods such as CT or (contrast enhanced) ultrasound.
FP|PMC5145252_S154|POS|NEG|Further studies are needed to establish the process of post-IRE healing in these imaging methods.
TN|PMC5145252_S31|NEG|NEG|We included consecutive patients who underwent percutaneous CT-guided IRE for ablation of liver malignancies over a 3-year period (2012 through 2015).
TN|PMC5145252_S35|NEG|NEG|without prognostically relevant extrahepatic tumor burden, and
TN|PMC5145252_S44|NEG|NEG|The standardized pulse sequence protocol is given in Table 1.
TN|PMC5152707_S103|NEG|NEG|The data were collected by review of the electronic medical record at each participating site.
TN|PMC5152707_S113|NEG|NEG|The phrase “Test if Chest Pain Choice safely improves validated patient-centered outcome measures” refers to the five additional outcome measures listed as secondary outcomes at clinicaltrials.gov (a through e) and is redundant.
TN|PMC5152707_S120|NEG|NEG|For continuous outcomes we used linear models, and for categorical outcomes we used multinomial (polytomous) logistic models.
TN|PMC5152707_S141|NEG|NEG|Patients randomized to the decision aid had greater knowledge (questions correct out of 8: decision aid, 4.2 v usual care, 3.6; mean difference 0.66, 95% confidence interval 0.46 to 0.86; table 2).
TN|PMC5152707_S155|NEG|NEG|A significantly lower proportion of patients randomized to the decision aid decided, with their clinician, to be admitted to the emergency department observation unit for cardiac stress testing or CCTA (decision aid, 37.3% v usual care, 52.1%; absolute difference 14.8%, 95% confidence interval 1.1% to 13.9%), and a significantly lower proportion underwent cardiac stress testing within 30 days (decision aid, 38.1% v usual care, 45.6%; 7.5%, 1.1% to 13.9%; table 3).
TN|PMC5152707_S161|NEG|NEG|These patients were admitted to the hospital for further evaluation and management and received a diagnosis of non-ST segment elevation myocardial infarction.
TN|PMC5152707_S162|NEG|NEG|The fourth case of myocardial infarction in the decision aid arm occurred in a patient who had negative serial cardiac troponin results and no acute ischemic changes on the ECG but symptoms suggestive of acute coronary syndrome.
TN|PMC5152707_S163|NEG|NEG|This patient was admitted to the hospital, underwent percutaneous coronary intervention, and subsequently developed in-stent thrombosis.
TN|PMC5152707_S165|NEG|NEG|The patient underwent a second percutaneous coronary intervention and recovered uneventfully.
TN|PMC5152707_S179|NEG|NEG|Rather, patient centered interventions such as those tested in this trial indicate that patients, when educated and informed of their risk, might choose with their clinician to undergo less extensive evaluation more closely tailored to their personalized risk.
FP|PMC5152707_S185|POS|NEG|Several limitations of this trial should be taken into consideration.
TP|PMC5152707_S186|POS|POS|The quantitative pretest probability web tool8 9 only applies to patients with chest pain.
TP|PMC5152707_S187|POS|POS|As such, the decision aid cannot be used in patients with potential acute coronary syndrome who present with non-chest pain syndromes (eg, shortness of breath, diaphoresis).
TP|PMC5152707_S188|POS|POS|In addition, more accurate methods to estimate patient risk, such as those incorporating high sensitivity troponin C assays, are likely to become available.
FP|PMC5152707_S189|POS|NEG|In the future it might be preferable to generate risk estimates with these methods and select the decision aid that corresponds to this level of risk.
FP|PMC5152707_S190|POS|NEG|We used two versions of the decision aid in the trial—one that included the option of coronary computed tomography angiography (CCTA) and one that included only cardiac stress testing.
TP|PMC5152707_S191|POS|POS|Although this introduced a degree of heterogeneity in the intervention, the trial was intentionally pragmatic in design, and contextual fit of the decision aid to facilitate clinician-patient discussions relevant to the clinical settings enrolling patients in the trial was essential.
FP|PMC5152707_S192|POS|NEG|In addition, evidence now supports application of the shared decision making tool in clinical care contexts where CCTA is frequently used and in practice settings where cardiac stress testing is more commonly used.
TP|PMC5152707_S193|POS|POS|We randomized at the patient level, increasing the risk of contamination between intervention and control groups.
FP|PMC5152707_S194|POS|NEG|To limit the risk of contamination, the quantitative pretest probability web tool was password protected, and coordinators did not provide clinicians access to the decision aid.
TN|PMC5152707_S195|NEG|NEG|However, even if contamination were to occur, this would bias the results of the trial toward the null, and we observed a positive effect of the intervention despite the potential for contamination.
TP|PMC5152707_S196|POS|POS|Although we reviewed electronic medical records and attempted to contact all enrolled patients, we were unable to contact 70 (8%) for assessment of a secondary outcome.
FP|PMC5152707_S197|POS|NEG|Of these, 68 were confirmed alive at 45 days.
FP|PMC5152707_S198|POS|NEG|The 92% phone follow-up rate supplemented by mortality review from a national database is, however, robust and comparable to other high quality studies of patients in the emergency department setting with potential acute coronary syndrome.
TP|PMC5152707_S199|POS|POS|We were unable to obtain video recordings in 40% of the encounters.
TN|PMC5152707_S200|NEG|NEG|However, the 536 video recordings that were obtained exceeded the required sample size of 221 needed to meet power estimates.
TP|PMC5152707_S201|POS|POS|The study had 78% power to detect a 5% difference in MACEs between study arms, using a one sided non-inferiority test with an α of 0.05.
TP|PMC5152707_S202|POS|POS|Although this was substantially greater power than the initial cohort of patients recruited in our single center pilot trial, greater power and precision would be optimal.
FP|PMC5152707_S203|POS|NEG|It is critical that evidence based local practice protocols to definitively rule out acute myocardial infarction with serial cardiac troponin tests be reliably followed in all patients, regardless of the decision to undergo further cardiac stress testing during the index emergency department visit or to follow-up as an outpatient.
FP|PMC5152707_S204|POS|NEG|This is highlighted by the fact that four patients in the decision aid group and one patient in the usual care group were diagnosed as having acute myocardial infarction during their index presentation.
FP|PMC5152707_S205|POS|NEG|Although no patients in this trial were ruled out for acute myocardial infarction using serial cardiac troponin results, were discharged home from the hospital without further testing, or subsequently experienced an acute myocardial infarction before follow-up as an outpatient, this scenario is possible, and a large scale implementation trial is needed to definitively assess safety.
TN|PMC5152707_S220|NEG|NEG|While the findings from this multicenter trial suggest that the decision aid might be effective across a variety of clinical settings, further implementation studies are needed to determine how best to incorporate it in care pathways, how emergency clinicians, cardiologists, and primary care clinicians can best work together to ensure incorporation and implementation of informed patient preferences into admission, testing, and follow-up decisions, and how to ensure patient preferences guide decision making both during and after the emergency department encounter.
TN|PMC5152707_S26|NEG|NEG|This was a pragmatic parallel randomized controlled trial in low risk patients presenting to the emergency department with a potential acute coronary syndrome.
TN|PMC5152707_S36|NEG|NEG|Allocation was concealed by an online password protected randomization algorithm (Medidata Balance; Medidata Solutions, New York City, NY).
TN|PMC5152707_S43|NEG|NEG|We sought to assist patients and clinicians in making a risk informed shared decision in the emergency setting in which patients typically do not have the opportunity to learn about their condition prior to the visit and clinicians often make decisions unilaterally to facilitate patient safety and rapid treatment of life threatening conditions.
TN|PMC5152707_S46|NEG|NEG|Prior to conducting the trial, we refined the decision aid to ensure contextual fit with each practice setting.
TN|PMC5152707_S51|NEG|NEG|For patients randomized to the decision aid, a study coordinator collected each of the variables needed to populate the quantitative probability web tool,14 asked the treating clinician to sign off on their accuracy, and calculated the patient’s pretest probability of acute coronary syndrome, incorporating the result of the first troponin test but prior to subsequent biomarker testing (fig 2).
TN|PMC5152707_S52|NEG|NEG|After selecting the decision aid corresponding to the appropriate level of risk, the study coordinator offered to provide the clinician with a concise refresher of the content.
TN|PMC5152707_S58|NEG|NEG|As the trial was intentionally pragmatic in design, usual care was not standardized.12
TN|PMC5152707_S70|NEG|NEG|If patients were unable to be reached by phone or email and no subsequent visits in the electronic medical record were documented, mortality status was verified using Accurint, a national database frequently used by banks and other businesses to track individuals and ensure payment collection.22
TN|PMC5152707_S73|NEG|NEG|When designing the trial, the patient adviser, caregiver adviser, and emergency department patient advisory council at the Saint Marys Hospital at Mayo Clinic provided input on the prioritization and selection of outcomes.
TN|PMC5152707_S91|NEG|NEG|The scale ranges from 0-100, where higher values are reflective of higher levels of patient trust in their physician.
TN|PMC5154975_S26|NEG|NEG|Given the complexity of olfactory receptors it is likely that additional genetic variations contribute to the differences in humans’ ability to detect the odor of asparagus metabolites.
TN|PMC5154975_S38|NEG|NEG|We carried out multivariable logistic regression analyses, modeling single nucleotide polymorphisms as ordinal variables and asparagus anosmia as the outcome.
TN|PMC5154975_S39|NEG|NEG|Models were adjusted for age, sex, smoking status (never, former, and current), and the first three principal components of genetic variation (to adjust for potential confounding by ethnicity).
TN|PMC5154975_S45|NEG|NEG|We then used the variant effect predictor tool to determine the effect of the variants on the amino acid sequence.
TN|PMC5154976_S112|NEG|NEG|Firstly, it shows that duration of exposure to positive emotional states is important.
TN|PMC5154976_S119|NEG|NEG|We also measured self-rated health and limiting longstanding illness as indicators of less tangible health problems that might confound associations between positive wellbeing and mortality, and assessments of depressive symptoms to account for the presence of negative affective states.
TN|PMC5154976_S120|NEG|NEG|An analysis of the Million Women Study showed no association between a simple four point rating of frequency of happiness and survival, due in large part to a substantial overlap of the happiness ratings with self-rated health.11
TN|PMC5154976_S121|NEG|NEG|The number of reports of enjoyment was also associated with good self-rated health in the present study (table 1).
TN|PMC5154976_S122|NEG|NEG|Nevertheless, our observation that multiple reports of high enjoyment remained independent predictors of mortality when this and other factors had been included in the analytical models increases our confidence that associations are robust.
TN|PMC5154976_S123|NEG|NEG|Thirdly, we have documented associations between sustained wellbeing and death from non-cardiovascular causes as well as all cause mortality.
TN|PMC5154976_S124|NEG|NEG|Previous work has documented links between lower subjective wellbeing and cardiovascular disease incidence and longer survival.4 21 22
FN|PMC5154976_S125|NEG|POS|However, cardiovascular disease accounted for only around a third of deaths in this study, limiting statistical power to detect associations.
TN|PMC5154976_S126|NEG|NEG|The findings for deaths from non-cardiovascular causes suggest that subjective wellbeing has a more general association with survival.
FN|PMC5154976_S127|NEG|POS|This was an observational study, so we are not able to interpret the associations between enjoyment of life and survival as causal.
FN|PMC5154976_S128|NEG|POS|Although we controlled for a wide range of potential confounders, other unmeasured factors could be important.
FN|PMC5154976_S129|NEG|POS|Our assessment of initial health was not complete, even though we included general measures such as self-rated health as well as serious diagnosed conditions.
FN|PMC5154976_S130|NEG|POS|A substantial proportion of participants in ELSA did not complete all three assessments of enjoyment of life, either because they died during the four year measurement period or because they dropped out of the study temporarily or permanently.
TN|PMC5154976_S131|NEG|NEG|However, analyses of participants who completed all assessments showed results comparable to the multiply imputed datasets, indicating that attrition during the measurement period does not explain our findings.
TN|PMC5154976_S132|NEG|NEG|Subjective wellbeing has many facets, including hedonic wellbeing (feelings of happiness and joy), evaluative wellbeing (life satisfaction), and eudemonic wellbeing (judgments about meaning and purpose in life).23
TN|PMC5154976_S133|NEG|NEG|Our measure of enjoyment of life includes components of hedonic wellbeing, social engagement, and vitality, all of which might be important for sustained health.22
FN|PMC5154976_S134|NEG|POS|A limitation of this analysis was that we only assessed enjoyment of life every two years, and do not know whether it fluctuated between measurement points.18
TP|PMC5154976_S135|POS|POS|We also do not know about the pattern of enjoyment of participants’ lives before they enrolled in the study.
TP|PMC5154976_S136|POS|POS|The proportion of ethnic minority participants in ELSA was very small, and our results might not generalise to other cultures.
TP|PMC5154976_S137|POS|POS|Baseline health status was measured by self-report, but this has been shown to be quite comparable with physician examination in studies of adults of comparable age.24 25
TP|PMC5154976_S138|POS|POS|In defining covariates, we relied on baseline data rather than data from all three waves, because imputation of covariates at subsequent waves would increase uncertainty in multivariable adjusted effect estimates.
TN|PMC5154976_S148|NEG|NEG|Secondly, there could be direct biological correlates of positive wellbeing modulated through corticolimbic pathways that contribute to protective associations.
TN|PMC5154976_S157|NEG|NEG|Subjective wellbeing (feelings of enjoyment and satisfaction with life) has been associated with greater longevity in longitudinal population studies
TN|PMC5154976_S16|NEG|NEG|A meta-analysis of longitudinal observational studies published before 2008 indicated that greater wellbeing was associated with lower all cause mortality in initially healthy population cohorts (adjusted hazard ratio 0.82, 95% confidence interval 0.76 to 0.89), although there were indications of publication bias.3
TN|PMC5154976_S23|NEG|NEG|Evidence of time dependent exposure effects would increase confidence in a potential causal association.
TN|PMC5154976_S24|NEG|NEG|In the present analysis, we tested the notion that repeated reports over several years would have a stronger association with mortality than a single occurrence.
TN|PMC5154976_S25|NEG|NEG|We used measures of enjoyment of life taken three times at two year intervals between 2002 and 2006, and analysed associations with mortality up to 2013, predicting that a temporal dose-response association would be apparent.
TN|PMC5154976_S36|NEG|NEG|Enjoyment of life was indexed with four items from the CASP-19 quality of life instrument, as described previously.12 14
TN|PMC5154976_S40|NEG|NEG|We then generated a variable for enjoyment, defining no enjoyment as scores from 0 to 2, and high enjoyment if scores were 3 or 4 (meaning that the individual reported enjoyment on 3 or 4 of the items).
TN|PMC5154976_S42|NEG|NEG|Education was based on the highest qualification achieved and categorised into lower (no qualifications), intermediate (qualifications below college degree level), and higher (college degree or higher).
TN|PMC5154976_S54|NEG|NEG|We generated a sustained enjoyment variable by summing the number of reports of high enjoyment of life between 2002 and 2006; scores could range from none to three reports for each individual.
TN|PMC5154976_S57|NEG|NEG|Five models were tested in the analyses of all cause mortality.
TN|PMC5154976_S58|NEG|NEG|Model 1 was adjusted for age (categorised as 50-59, 60-69, 70-79, and ≥80 years) and sex.
TN|PMC5154976_S62|NEG|NEG|Separate regression analyses were carried out of non-cardiovascular deaths and deaths from cardiovascular disease.
TN|PMC5154976_S63|NEG|NEG|In addition, we modelled enjoyment of life as a continuous score (0, 1, 2, 3) where the hazard ratios represent (in the last column of each table) a one report increase of enjoyment of life.
TN|PMC5154976_S66|NEG|NEG|With imputations, all individuals in the initial sample had a measure of enjoyment at all three waves.
TN|PMC5154976_S71|NEG|NEG|Secondly, we examined all permutations of the timing of enjoyment ratings, to investigate different patterns in the high enjoyment reports (eg, one wave was wave 1 only, or wave 2 only or wave 3 only; two waves were waves 1 and 2, waves 2 and 3, or waves 1 and 3), and included deaths that occurred during the assessment of enjoyment of life (results available on request).
TN|PMC5154976_S77|NEG|NEG|No patients were asked to advise on interpretation or writing up of results.
TN|PMC5154976_S80|NEG|NEG|We found that 2264 (24%) participants reported no high levels of enjoyment of life on any occasion, with 1833 (20%) having one, 2063 (22%) having two, and 3205 (34%) having three reports of high enjoyment.
TN|PMC5154976_S98|NEG|NEG|The second sensitivity analysis explored whether different patterns of enjoyment over time were important in relation to mortality.
FN|PMC5154977_S27|NEG|POS|Because the number of people fulfilling the inclusion criteria who were exposed to the online posting of our study is not known, it was not possible to calculate the response rate.
TN|PMC5154977_S28|NEG|NEG|Of the 2225 people who responded to the survey, we excluded 115 who had downloaded Pokémon GO but not achieved a “trainer level” of 5 or more, which is reached after around two hours of walking.
TN|PMC5154977_S29|NEG|NEG|At this level, functions integral to the game are unlocked, including joining a team and competing for Pokémon gyms.
TN|PMC5154977_S54|NEG|NEG|The corresponding number for non-players in the four weeks preceding 8 July (median date of Pokémon GO installation among the players) was 4126 (SD 2930).
TN|PMC5156609_S12|NEG|NEG|Overall, 16% of spam invitations were duplicates and 83% had little or no relevance to the recipients’ research interests.
TP|PMC5156609_S141|POS|POS|Some invitations were removed by the institutional spam filter, so we might have underestimated the amount of spam.
TP|PMC5156609_S142|POS|POS|Our sample of researchers was too small to be representative of the academic community.
FP|PMC5156609_S143|POS|NEG|New Zealand is a small, remote country that might not be targeted by academic spam distributors, even though we have held the Rugby World Cup since 2011, and the Lord of the Rings movies were filmed here.
FP|PMC5156609_S144|POS|NEG|We received a similar number of spam invitations to colleagues in Poland and Canada who assessed journal invitations, however.2 3
TN|PMC5156609_S20|NEG|NEG|In the Academic Spam Study we investigated the amount, relevance, content, and suppressibility of academic spam emails.
TN|PMC5156609_S24|NEG|NEG|Invitations addressed the recipient as “Eminent Professor,” included five or more exclamation marks, and lacked an option to unsubscribe.
TN|PMC5156609_S69|NEG|NEG|Two, BIT Life Sciences and OMICS Group, did not offer unsubscription and remained prominent sources of spam related to conferences a year later.
TN|PMC5156611_S20|NEG|NEG|Using data from a large commercially insured US population, we analysed rates of BRCA testing and mastectomy before and after Jolie’s editorial.
TN|PMC5156611_S23|NEG|NEG|Our study included women aged 18-64 years in the United States who were continuously enrolled in commercial insurance during 2012-13.
TN|PMC5156611_S25|NEG|NEG|Details of this database have been published elsewhere.6
TP|PMC5156611_S70|POS|POS|Because we did not observe test results, we did not measure benefits associated with knowing one’s BRCA status such as peace of mind or increased vigilance after learning one’s risk factors.
TP|PMC5156611_S71|POS|POS|Moreover, as our data did not allow us to identify preventive mastectomies, preventive mastectomies among women who tested positive for the BRCA mutation may have increased after Jolie’s editorial even though overall mastectomy rates remained steady.
TP|PMC5156611_S72|POS|POS|Moreover, rates of mastectomy among women who tested positive for the BRCA mutation could have increased after the time captured by our study period.9 10
TP|PMC5156611_S73|POS|POS|Finally, although our study population was more general than that of previous studies, certain populations such as Medicare enrolees were not represented.
TN|PMC5156611_S78|NEG|NEG|Celebrity endorsements for health related matters such as preventive screening, fad diets, and supplements are ubiquitous
TN|PMC5156612_S10|NEG|NEG|In contrast, there was no correlation with school absenteeism, conviction rates, or distance to the North Pole.
TN|PMC5156612_S16|NEG|NEG|It has long been thought that Santa Claus visits children depending on whether they have been naughty or nice in the past year (fig 1).
TN|PMC5156612_S42|NEG|NEG|We calculated the proportions of paediatric wards visited by Santa Claus for each of the four countries and for regions within England (table 2).
TN|PMC5156612_S44|NEG|NEG|To explore associations between school absenteeism, conviction rates in young people, distance to North Pole, and contextual socioeconomic deprivation, we fit logistic regression models for the odds of no visit by Santa Claus, with each predictor modeled linearly.
TP|PMC5158000_S165|POS|POS|Our studies were performed in a murine model of permanent LAD ligation and future studies in larger animal models following ischemic reperfusion would be helpful to inform translation of the gene therapy.
TP|PMC5158000_S166|POS|POS|Furthermore, the inotropic effects studied in isolated cardiomyocytes were performed via peptide perfusion and further work to isolate cardiomyocytes from hearts infused in vivo with the gene therapy combined with use of patch clamping would enable full dissection of the inotropic effects of Ang-(1-9).
TN|PMC5158000_S167|NEG|NEG|Nonetheless, the current studies strongly support a beneficial effect of cardiac Ang-(1-9) gene therapy in the setting of MI.
TN|PMC5158000_S8|NEG|NEG|C57BL/6 mice underwent permanent left anterior descending coronary artery ligation and cardiac function was assessed using echocardiography for 8 weeks followed by a terminal measurement of left ventricular pressure volume loops.
TN|PMC5158000_S97|NEG|NEG|Quantitative polymerase chain reaction of levels of RAAS genes in cardiac complementary DNA revealed significantly increased ACE in all MI groups compared to sham, whereas ACE2 expression remained unchanged (Online Figures 2A and 2B).
TN|PMC5158000_S99|NEG|NEG|Mas expression was significantly downregulated in MI/AAVAng-(1-9) (Online Figure 2E).
TN|PMC5159977_S112|NEG|NEG|Endobronchial biopsies and epithelial brushings, taken at bifurcations of sub-segmental airways in the lower lobes, were immediately preserved in RNAlater® solution and then maintained at −70 °C [10, 11].
TN|PMC5159977_S184|NEG|NEG|The Pearson’s Contingency Coefficients representing the within-subject consistency of classified phenotype across visits were 0.81, 0.74, 0.76, and 0.78 for actual baseline phenotypes A1, A2, A3, and A4, respectively.
TN|PMC5159977_S215|NEG|NEG|Phenotype US4 was homologous to Phenotype A4.
TN|PMC5159977_S222|NEG|NEG|All 4 clusters had significantly higher SNOT scores (p < 7x10−5), particularly for clusters US3 and US4.
TN|PMC5159977_S250|NEG|NEG|Phenotype A1, was remarkably similar to Phenotype US1 from the U-BIOPRED validation set.
TN|PMC5159977_S293|NEG|NEG|We have observed that the T2-high phenotype is a subset of a broader eosinophilic phenotype group in ADEPT and U-BIOPRED studies [27], consistent with results from Choy et al. [28] in mild asthma (evaluating T2 phenotype status by POSTN, SERPINB2, and CLCA1 expression in endobronchial brushings).
TN|PMC5159977_S295|NEG|NEG|Phenotypes A1, A2, and A4 are then clinically distinguished by degree of asthma control and airflow limitations.
TP|PMC5159977_S296|POS|POS|Ideally T2 and eosinophilic inflammation would be established from airway mucosal and sputum sampling, but these are difficult to evaluate in a standard clinical setting.
TP|PMC5159977_S297|POS|POS|Blood eosinophils, FENO, and potentially serum proteins could serve as surrogates to establish these phenotypes, but alone are insufficient to define such.
FP|PMC5159977_S298|POS|NEG|Combinations of the surrogates, as utilized in the classification of the phenotype groups, are needed for more accurate estimation of T2 and eosinophilic phenotypes.
TN|PMC5159977_S30|NEG|NEG|These studies have used a range of clinical variables in combination with simple, easy to apply, measures of airways inflammation assessed in induced sputum [5–8].
TN|PMC5159977_S301|NEG|NEG|Post-hoc perturbation analyses (not reported) assessing the impact of adding in additional demographic, historical, and treatment attributes (e.g., gender, age, atopy, asthma age-of-onset, BMI, ICS dose; 20 variables total), resulted in weaker clustering (based on distance metrics and cluster membership probabilities), with qualitatively similar clinical associations as reported for the ADEPT asthma phenotypes (65% concordance of the most closely analogous clusters with the reported ADEPT asthma phenotypes).
TN|PMC5159977_S305|NEG|NEG|Compliance was not formally monitored in these studies.
TN|PMC5159977_S310|NEG|NEG|Nevertheless, there are also limitations.
TP|PMC5159977_S311|POS|POS|The actual prevalence of the clinical clusters cannot be directly estimated because participants were not randomly recruited from the general asthma population.
FP|PMC5159977_S312|POS|NEG|ADEPT had strict inclusion/exclusion criteria to restrict enrollment to patients likely to be enrolled in interventional clinical studies.
TP|PMC5159977_S313|POS|POS|Thus morbidly obese participants, smoking participants and chronic OCS-treated participants are not represented in ADEPT.
FP|PMC5159977_S314|POS|NEG|In contrast, U-BIOPRED did include smokers and chronic OCS treated patients, with almost 50% of asthmatics on chronic OCS therapy.
TN|PMC5159977_S315|NEG|NEG|These features in fact predominated in the distinction of the 4 clinical clusters that have been reported with the U-BIOPRED cohort [29] (Additional file 1: Section S12).
TN|PMC5159977_S316|NEG|NEG|Indeed, 4 clusters were identified, of which the first consisted of well-controlled mild-to-moderate asthmatics, while the 3 other clusters consisting of predominantly severe asthma patients were characterised by 2 clusters of chronic airflow obstruction, one with late-onset asthma in predominant smokers/ex-smokers with high BMI and the other in non-smokers with high OCS use; the fourth cluster consisted of predominantly obese female patients with uncontrolled asthma and increased exacerbations, but with normal lung function [29].
TN|PMC5159977_S76|NEG|NEG|Figure 1 describes the overall schematic of clustering analyses.
TN|PMC5159977_S92|NEG|NEG|Sensitivity analyses were performed to assess the robustness of these initial clusters in ADEPT (removing the medoid subjects and whole study arms), the longitudinal stability of the clusters, and the homologous clusters observed when clustering on U-BIOPRED subjects, overcome the limitations of not employing permutations.
TN|PMC5161109_S5|NEG|NEG|Disparities may differentially influence risk for cancer during early life and create opportunities to promote health equity.
TN|PMC5161777_S110|NEG|NEG|Most of these countries are in southern Asia.
TN|PMC5161777_S115|NEG|NEG|Three of these ten countries (Angola, Nigeria, and DR Congo) are among the ten countries with the most under-5 deaths mentioned above.
TN|PMC5161777_S199|NEG|NEG|Based on preliminary results from the Strategic Timing of Antiretroviral Treatment study, which was done among adults,37 WHO revised its HIV treatment recommendation to “treat-all”, that is to treat anyone living with HIV with antiretroviral as soon as possible and to offer people at high risk with preventive antiretrovirals.38
TN|PMC5161777_S69|NEG|NEG|Details of the parameters used in the post-hoc adjustment are available in the appendix (p 7).
TN|PMC5162097_S131|NEG|NEG|By contrast, in the Lung Health Study [40] and in a 2.5-years follow up of 64 COPD patients by Kessler et al. [41] there was no significant difference in the risk of hospital admission between current smokers and ex-smokers.
TN|PMC5162097_S19|NEG|NEG|COPD is estimated to become the third leading cause of death in 2030 (www.who.int/whosis/whostat/2008/en/).
TN|PMC5162097_S20|NEG|NEG|As expected, COPD and the catastrophic complications of advanced stage disease impose a substantial economic burden on healthcare systems; in the US alone, direct costs of COPD have been estimated at $29.5 billion, with indirect costs of $20.4 billion [8].
TN|PMC5162097_S94|NEG|NEG|Nonetheless, a significant reduction in conventional cigarette consumption was also observed in dual users, with their mean (±SD) cigarettes/day use decreasing from 23.7 (±5.4) at baseline to 4 (±1.2) at F/up1 and to 3.5 (±1.3) at F/up2, respectively (p < 0.001 for both visits) (Table 3).
TN|PMC5164296_S14|NEG|NEG|This trial is registered with Clinicaltrials.gov (NCT01689246) and the European Union Clinical Trials Registry (2012-002866-11).
TN|PMC5164296_S6|NEG|NEG|We aimed to determine whether LMTM was safe and effective in modifying disease progression in patients with mild to moderate Alzheimer’s disease.
TN|PMC5176077_S38|NEG|NEG|Communication (verbal and non-verbal) and team-working skills are similarly not (yet) readily taught using these devices.
TN|PMC5176077_S4|NEG|NEG|Finally, recommendations are made for those developing and using such tools, based on current literature and the authors' involvement in the field.
TN|PMC5176077_S70|NEG|NEG|While it may seem obvious, training tools are likely to need modification to be appropriate for different environments.
TN|PMC5176077_S81|NEG|NEG|Second, however, mobile technology lends itself to a host of other analytic tools: uptake (downloads), completion, repetition, scores in training and so forth.
TN|PMC5176330_S12|NEG|NEG|There was a 5-fold greater reduction in coronary events when troponin concentrations decreased by more than a quarter, rather than increased by more than a quarter, for both placebo (HR: 0.29; 95% CI: 0.12 to 0.72 vs.
TP|PMC5176330_S143|POS|POS|The trial was conducted in middle-aged men with raised cholesterol levels, and the findings may not be applicable to the wider population including women.
TP|PMC5176330_S144|POS|POS|This is an important point, as the threshold of 5.2 ng/l that identified men at increased risk in our study population may not apply to women or to other groups (16).
TP|PMC5176330_S145|POS|POS|We were able to obtain results from only 3,318 participants, and the requirement for a 1-year sample restricted the study population to those who were compliant with the protocol.
FP|PMC5176330_S146|POS|NEG|This is the most likely explanation for the apparently greater treatment effect in this study compared to the intention-to-treat risk reduction reported previously (8).
TP|PMC5176330_S147|POS|POS|Our analysis was performed on samples stored for 20 years, and it is possible we underestimated the association between troponin and coronary heart disease events because of interference from the formation of fibrin microparticulates during storage.
FP|PMC5176330_S148|POS|NEG|Although the effect of pravastatin on troponin concentrations was highly consistent across the study population, the absolute and relative reductions were modest at 2 ng/l and 19%, respectively.
TP|PMC5176330_S149|POS|POS|Although assay precision is very good at concentrations below our median concentration of 4.1 ng/l (∼10% coefficient of variation) (25) and even smaller changes in cardiac troponin concentration were strongly associated with coronary heart disease events across the study population, we acknowledge it will be more challenging to monitor changes accurately in individual patients.
TP|PMC5176330_S150|POS|POS|Changes in troponin concentration of 2 ng/l after initiation of statin therapy may be masked by other aspects of biological or analytical variability (26).
TN|PMC5176330_S151|NEG|NEG|However, there are methodological approaches to reduce the former, for example, performing duplicate measurements 2 weeks apart, and novel technologies that enhance assay precision through single molecular counting that will minimize the latter (27).
FP|PMC5176330_S152|POS|NEG|Before this approach can be applied in clinical practice, prospective studies are needed to determine whether we can consistently quantify small changes in cardiac troponin I concentration in response to treatment in individuals.
TN|PMC5176330_S154|NEG|NEG|Cardiac troponin I is an independent predictor of coronary heart disease events in middle-aged hypercholesterolemic men without prior myocardial infarction.
TN|PMC5176330_S156|NEG|NEG|These findings suggest that high-sensitivity cardiac troponin has major potential to identify those at greatest risk and to assess their response to interventions for the prevention of coronary heart disease.
TN|PMC5176330_S3|NEG|NEG|Cardiac troponin is an independent predictor of cardiovascular mortality in individuals without symptoms or signs of cardiovascular disease.
TN|PMC5176330_S30|NEG|NEG|WOSCOPS randomized 6,595 men ages 45 to 64 years with moderate hypercholesterolemia (LDL cholesterol concentrations 152 to 228 mg/dl) and no prior history of myocardial infarction to receive placebo or pravastatin 40 mg/day.
TN|PMC5176330_S38|NEG|NEG|Cardiac troponin I concentrations in stored plasma were determined at baseline and at 1 year using the ARCHITECTSTAT high-sensitive troponin I assay (Abbott Laboratories, Abbott Park, Illinois).
TN|PMC5176330_S40|NEG|NEG|The upper reference limit or 99th-centile value is 34 ng/l in men (16).
TN|PMC5176330_S66|NEG|NEG|For the purpose of this analysis, 7 participants with undetectable troponin concentrations were assigned a value of 1.2 ng/l.
TN|PMC5176330_S84|NEG|NEG|The absolute change in troponin concentration from baseline with pravastatin was 2.0 ng/l (interquartile range: 1.2 to 2.8 ng/l; p < 0.001).
TN|PMC5176330_S96|NEG|NEG|lowest quarter: >3% increase) had the largest reduction in cardiovascular events (HR: 0.21.
TN|PMC5179309_S14|NEG|NEG|A cavitation safety algorithm was developed based on logistic regression of the measurements and tested to minimize risks of hemorrhage.
TN|PMC5179309_S8|NEG|NEG|A partial human skull was positioned over the animal’s brain.
TN|PMC5179316_S12|NEG|NEG|This study suggests that TNF-α inhibitors may have a comparable rate of serious infections to the range of those observed in registry databases when used in patients with HIV infection under active care.
TN|PMC5181129_S121|NEG|NEG|When estimating only midline hernia recurrence, the Kaplan-Meier recurrence rate at 24 months was 14%.
TN|PMC5181129_S122|NEG|NEG|The recurrence rate was higher in patients with mesh placement in the intraperitoneal position (40%; 4/10) versus those with placement in the retrorectus position (13% [12/94]; P = 0.0451).
TN|PMC5181129_S124|NEG|NEG|Time to hernia recurrence was shorter for patients with postoperative infection than those patients without (P = 0.0098) (Supplemental Digital Content Fig. 2) and with parastomal compared with midline hernia recurrences (P < 0.0001) (Supplemental Digital Content Fig. 3).
TN|PMC5181129_S132|NEG|NEG|No cases required complete explantation of the biosynthetic mesh.
TN|PMC5181129_S133|NEG|NEG|All wounds were completely healed at long-term follow-up.
TN|PMC5181129_S14|NEG|NEG|Hernia recurrence rate was 17% (n = 16).
TN|PMC5181129_S149|NEG|NEG|Overall, hernia recurrence occurred in 16 patients with a Kaplan-Meier recurrence rate of 17% at 24 months.
TN|PMC5181129_S151|NEG|NEG|In fact, the Repair of Infected and Contaminated Hernias (RICH) trial is the only long-term, multicentered, prospective trial to evaluate biologic mesh in CDC class II to IV wounds.9
TN|PMC5181129_S17|NEG|NEG|Mean 24-month EQ-5D (index and visual analogue) and SF-12 physical component and mental scores improved from baseline (P < 0.05).
TN|PMC5181129_S181|NEG|NEG|As such, the surgical community is reluctant to do so until high-level clinical outcomes data are available.
TN|PMC5181129_S182|NEG|NEG|Furthermore, large-pore, reduced-weight mesh does have its limitations.
TN|PMC5181129_S183|NEG|NEG|Petro et al25 described 7 patients with central mesh failure after ventral hernia repair with lightweight monofilament polyester mesh placed in the retrorectus position with complete posterior and anterior fascial coverage.
TN|PMC5181129_S184|NEG|NEG|In clean or CDC class I wounds, a prospective randomized trial demonstrated a trend (P = 0.052) toward an increased recurrence rate for large-pore, lightweight mesh (17%) compared with “standard” mesh (7%) for retrorectus ventral hernia repairs.26
TN|PMC5181129_S188|NEG|NEG|The absorption profile of the synthetic mesh, degradation versus time, may alter “constructive remodeling,” but comparative biomechanical data are not available.
TN|PMC5181129_S191|NEG|NEG|As a result, a greater focus has been made on assessing quality of life surrounding surgical procedures.
TN|PMC5181129_S192|NEG|NEG|Some groups have gathered significant data and have successfully generated quality-of-life assessment tools specific to a surgical procedure or a disease process.
TN|PMC5181129_S196|NEG|NEG|Not surprisingly, assessment of physical health at 1 month after surgery showed an initial drop as patients still contended with postoperative discomfort.
TN|PMC5181129_S197|NEG|NEG|However, the results seen in the SF-12 mental health domain suggested a more complex impact of hernia repair on these patients.
TN|PMC5181129_S203|NEG|NEG|The definition of a successful outcome is not clear.
TN|PMC5181129_S207|NEG|NEG|This study is not without limitations.
TP|PMC5181129_S208|POS|POS|First, the selected study format of a longitudinal observation of a patient cohort potentially limits the ability to apply these results.
TP|PMC5181129_S209|POS|POS|Lack of a control group or any element of randomization does introduce an opportunity to suggest that alternative mesh options, including a biologic product, could provide a similar outcome.
TP|PMC5181129_S210|POS|POS|Second, the duration of follow-up of 24 months is a commonly selected time point, but it is well understood that the longer hernia repair patients are followed, the greater the rate of recurrence.
FN|PMC5181129_S211|NEG|POS|However, the product used in this study undergoes hydrolysis, as it is replaced with vascularized soft tissue.
FP|PMC5181129_S212|POS|NEG|This process is generally considered to have completed by 6 to 7 months.
FP|PMC5181129_S213|POS|NEG|Therefore, the 24-month window seems to provide a more than adequate time period for recurrence to develop.
TP|PMC5181129_S214|POS|POS|Third, the diversity of hernia size may represent a challenge to draw conclusions.
TP|PMC5181129_S215|POS|POS|Inclusion criteria allowed hernias as small as 9 cm2.
TN|PMC5181129_S216|NEG|NEG|However, the mean defect size was 137 cm2, with a range from 10 to 513 cm2.
FP|PMC5181129_S217|POS|NEG|So, the majority of hernias were well in excess of this minimum.
TP|PMC5181129_S218|POS|POS|Fourth, the clinical characteristics of patients varied within the study group, with several patients undergoing straightforward, clean-contaminated cases simultaneous to hernia repair, whereas others underwent contaminated cases that addressed infected mesh removal.
TP|PMC5181129_S219|POS|POS|Arguably, this could have also been approached with separated cohorts.
TP|PMC5181129_S220|POS|POS|Fifth, there are still inherent limitations of outcomes research (eg, quality-of-life indices) in patients with complex ventral hernia repair.
TP|PMC5181129_S221|POS|POS|The definition of a successful outcome is not as clear as would be desired.
TP|PMC5181129_S222|POS|POS|Sixth, physical examination, although an appropriate standard for assessment, is not as accurate as a computerized tomogram (CT).
FP|PMC5181129_S223|POS|NEG|Routine postoperative CT examination of the abdominal wall would have been more accurate.
TN|PMC5181129_S224|NEG|NEG|However, this approach to hernia assessment has proven controversial as well.
FP|PMC5181129_S225|POS|NEG|In some studies, the CT findings were not associated with sign or symptoms of a hernia.
TP|PMC5181129_S226|POS|POS|The clinical relevance of this scenario is not clear and in fact raises more questions than not.
FP|PMC5181129_S227|POS|NEG|Therefore, relying on clinical evaluation with questioning and physical examination is more appropriate.
TP|PMC5181129_S228|POS|POS|Finally, the generalizability of any multicenter prospective trial or for that matter randomized controlled trial is always subject to real-time data and experience.
TN|PMC5181129_S231|NEG|NEG|The use of a biosynthetic alternative to biologic mesh provides a clear opportunity for reducing costs in caring for these complex patients.
TN|PMC5181129_S52|NEG|NEG|An anterior component separation was performed when external oblique muscles were released.
TN|PMC5181129_S58|NEG|NEG|Antibiotics were continued for the first 24 hours according to Surgical Care Improvement Project (SCIP) protocols.
TN|PMC5181129_S64|NEG|NEG|For analysis purposes, if the prosthetic material came in contact with a stoma site in patients with a concomitant stoma with or without a parastomal hernia component, it was considered part of the primary repair.
TN|PMC5181129_S67|NEG|NEG|Wound events were classified as surgical site infections based on CDC criteria into superficial, deep, or organ space.12
TN|PMC5181129_S70|NEG|NEG|If surgical debridement was required, prosthetic management was defined as: no intervention, partial resection, or full removal of the biosynthetic mesh.
TN|PMC5181129_S79|NEG|NEG|Patients completed the questionnaire based on how good or bad their health was for that day of administration relative to their ventral hernia repair from which a single-digit score described the patients’ health state.
TN|PMC5181129_S92|NEG|NEG|Statistical differences for the SF-12 and EQ-5D over time were evaluated using paired t tests, using P < 0.05 as the cut-off for statistical significance.
TN|PMC5181129_S94|NEG|NEG|Statistical analysis was done using SAS Software (Cary, NC), version 9.2.
TN|PMC5181647_S116|NEG|NEG|Coronary CTA has also documented the adverse prognosis associated with nonobstructive disease (not detected with standard perfusion assessments) and confirmed the excellent prognosis for patients with a normal coronary CTA, with a risk of cardiovascular events of <0.5% that extends up to 5 years (50).
TN|PMC5181647_S142|NEG|NEG|Nevertheless, CMR angiography allows assessment of the proximal and midcoronary vessels with an accuracy approaching that of CTA (26).
TN|PMC5181647_S225|NEG|NEG|T2-weighted short-tau inversion recovery (STIR) imaging detects regions of myocardial edema, helping to differentiate acute from chronic infarction and to allow calculation of the myocardial area at risk (95).
TN|PMC5181647_S228|NEG|NEG|The assessment of global and regional function in the left ventricle is performed routinely using echocardiography.
TN|PMC5181797_S138|NEG|NEG|While neither antibody demonstrated a clearly superior outcome in the present analysis, the OS curves split after 2.5 years, about 1.5 years after disease progression on first-line therapy, thereafter appearing to favor the cetuximab combination (Fig. 2B).
TN|PMC5181797_S15|NEG|NEG|Approximately 15% of colorectal cancer (CRC) patients would present with metastatic disease at diagnosis, and a further 40% to 50% would continuously develop metastases through the course of disease.[1,2]
FN|PMC5181797_S151|NEG|POS|However, it should be noted that KRAS wild-type patients were limited in the bevacizumab group (n = 63).
TN|PMC5181797_S156|NEG|NEG|It causes the terminal stage of colorectal cancer; diminishes quality of life by ascites retention, malnutrition, and intestinal obstruction; and is associated with a poor prognosis.[49,50]
TN|PMC5181799_S152|NEG|NEG|We conclude that (1) the younger age of CSS, the greater occurrence rate of complicating myocarditis and the poorer prognosis; (2) female CSS patients are older than male patients; (3) patients with cardiac involvement usually have a history of severe asthma; (4) markedly increased eosinophil count suggests a potential diagnosis of CSS (when the count increases to 20% of white blood cell counts or 8.1×109/L, eosinophils start to infiltrate into myocardium); and (5) negative ANCA status is associated with heart disease in CSS.
TN|PMC5181799_S27|NEG|NEG|Arterial blood gas analysis revealed pH 7.42, PaO2 51 mm Hg, PaCO2 28 mm Hg.
TN|PMC5181799_S38|NEG|NEG|Transthoracic echocardiography revealed a dilated hypokinetic left ventricle (left ventricular ejection fraction ∼40%) with mild segmental abnormalities in the septal and apical segments.
TN|PMC5181799_S77|NEG|NEG|The incidence of myocarditis in CSS patients 20 to 30 years old (22.7%) was higher than that for other groups.
TN|PMC5181800_S102|NEG|NEG|In the present study, pretreatment with 150 mg pregabalin was effective in reducing propofol injection pain, which was comparable with pretreatment with lidocaine 40 mg with venous retention.
TN|PMC5181800_S104|NEG|NEG|The present study had some limitations.
TP|PMC5181800_S105|POS|POS|First, placebo group was not examined to determine the baseline incidence of pain following propofol injection.
TN|PMC5181800_S106|NEG|NEG|Pain during propofol injection is a common clinical problem.[3,5,6]
FP|PMC5181800_S107|POS|NEG|Therefore, in this study, it was considered unethical that patients given propofol did not receive prophylactic analgesics.
TP|PMC5181800_S108|POS|POS|Second, in this study, premedication was not administered, which could affect pain on injection of propofol.
TN|PMC5181800_S109|NEG|NEG|The incidence of postoperative recall of this pain was about 50% to 87% if sedative or anxiolytic premedication was not given.[8,28]
TN|PMC5181800_S110|NEG|NEG|The recall of pain during injection of propofol can decrease patient's satisfaction with anesthetic care.[8]
TP|PMC5181800_S111|POS|POS|Therefore, another study will be required to investigate the postoperative recall for this pain.
TN|PMC5181800_S24|NEG|NEG|However, unfortunately this treatment could not abolish the pain.
TN|PMC5181800_S26|NEG|NEG|Therefore, propofol long-chain triglycerides (LCT)/medium-chain triglycerides (MCT) was introduced in attempts to prevent injection pain by reducing the concentration of aqueous-free propofol.[7]
TN|PMC5181800_S28|NEG|NEG|It was demonstrated that pretreatment with lidocaine with venous retention before injection of propofol LCT or lidocaine premixed in propofol LCT were more effective in reducing pain than a more expensive reformulation of propofol-LCT/MCT.[8,9]
TN|PMC5181800_S34|NEG|NEG|Therefore, we evaluated the effect of pretreatment with oral pregabalin 75 and 150 mg on pain from propofol injection, compared with intravenous lidocaine 40 mg with venous occlusion.
TN|PMC5181800_S68|NEG|NEG|Statistical significance was accepted at P < 0.05.
TN|PMC5181800_S73|NEG|NEG|The overall incidence of propofol injection pain was significantly decreased in group L (55%) and group HP (50%), compared with group LP (92.5%) (P < 0.05, respectively).
TN|PMC5181800_S95|NEG|NEG|The fundamental mechanism of action of pregabalin is the reduction of release of calcium by binding to α2-δ subunit of calcium channels, which inhibit excitatory neurotransmitter including glutamate and increase neuronal GABA levels.[18]
TN|PMC5181801_S11|NEG|NEG|The risk factors of LEAD in Chinese patients with T2DM include age, course of disease, uric acid, and GFR.
TN|PMC5181801_S113|NEG|NEG|Therefore, UA levels monitoring has a prognostic value for chronic micro/macrovascular complications in diabetic patients.
TN|PMC5181801_S137|NEG|NEG|Therefore, additional larger clinical studies are warranted to confirm the risk factors of LEAD reported in this study.
TN|PMC5181801_S80|NEG|NEG|Independent variables with P < 0.05 in univariate analyses were entered in the multivariate logistic regression.
TN|PMC5181802_S101|NEG|NEG|Then cell apoptosis was detected by flow cytometry at 48 hours post-transfection.
TN|PMC5181802_S59|NEG|NEG|Optical density was measured at 570 nm by a microplate reader Multiskan Go (Thermo Scientific).
TN|PMC5181802_S7|NEG|NEG|Cell viability and apoptosis were detected by 3-(4,5-dimethylthiazol-2-yl)-2,5-diphenyltetrazolium bromide (MTT) assay and flow cytometry after transfection.
TN|PMC5181802_S84|NEG|NEG|qPCR was performed on QuantStudio 6 Flex Realtime PCR system (Applied Biosystems, Carlsbad, CA) with specific primers for BRG1 (Fw: 5′-GCTCA AGGCC ATCGA GGAG-3′ and Rv: 5′-GGTGA AGACC GACTG CAAGA-3′), MMP3 (Fw: 5′-ACAAA GGATA CAACA GGGAC CAA-3′ and Rv: 5′-CAATT TCATG AGCAG CAACG A-3′), TIMP2 (5′-ACATT TATGG CAACC CTATC AA-3′ and Rv: 5′-TCAGG CCCTT TGAAC ATCTT TA-3′), cyclooxygenase 2 (COX2, 5′-TTCCA TTGAC CAGAG CAGGC AGAT-3′ and Rv: 5′-GCATC GATGT CACCA TAGAG TGCT-3′), interleukin 6 (IL6, 5′-CCTCA CCCTC CAACA AAGAT-3′ and Rv: 5′-GCCTC AGACA TCTCC AGTCC-3′) or p53 (5′-ACGAC GGTGA CACGC TTCCC TG-3′ and Rv: 5′-CGCTA GGATC TGACT GCGGC TC-3′) in each reaction system.
TN|PMC5181803_S40|NEG|NEG|The half amount of medium was first refreshed after 48 hours and then after every 3 days.
TN|PMC5181803_S83|NEG|NEG|Cytometry analysis showed that there were similar proportions of G1 cells in MSCs transfusion and control mice (64.24% vs 69.98%; Table 2), whereas irradiated mice had significantly more G1 cells than the other 2 groups (90.53% vs 64.24% and 69.98%).
TN|PMC5181803_S84|NEG|NEG|There were less cells arrested in S phase in the radiation group compared with that in the control group (5.77% vs 22.62%), but the difference disappeared after MSCs transfusion (21.43%; Table 2).
TN|PMC5181803_S92|NEG|NEG|When looked at CD4+/CD8− T cells, less numbers of cells were arrested at S phase in radiation group than in control group, and the number increased insignificantly after MSCs transfusion (Table 3).
TN|PMC5181804_S158|NEG|NEG|Another literature reports that the level of CA125 appears to correlate with disease activity, disease-free and overall survival in patients of non-Hodgkin lymphoma.[35]
TN|PMC5181804_S163|NEG|NEG|However, there were still some limitations.
TP|PMC5181804_S164|POS|POS|As this was a retrospective study, the definition of Borrmann type and grading was not strictly unified, so there may be systematic bias.
TP|PMC5181804_S165|POS|POS|Besides, the information was incomplete in some patients, which affected the credibility of our study.
TP|PMC5181804_S166|POS|POS|The number of cases of distant metastasis was limited and relevant results need a larger number of cases to verify.
TN|PMC5181804_S175|NEG|NEG|Esophageal involvement, T grade, and CA125 were risk factors of curability.
TN|PMC5181804_S177|NEG|NEG|T grade and CA125 were risk factors of N status.
TN|PMC5181804_S92|NEG|NEG|Of all clinicopathological factors, age, gastric body, gastric antrum, esophageal involvement, T grade, and grading of cancer were associated with curability (Table 1).
TN|PMC5181806_S106|NEG|NEG|This case indicated that PDRN could positively modify PTTD after ankle syndesmotic injury.
TN|PMC5181806_S25|NEG|NEG|However, syndesmosis injuries occasionally contribute to chronic instability and tendon injury.[2]
TN|PMC5181806_S69|NEG|NEG|The etiology of PTTD is likely to be multifactorial because both extrinsic such as ankle surgery and intrinsic risk factors have been reported.[9]
TN|PMC5181806_S90|NEG|NEG|A detailed explanation of PDRN was provided to the patient who consented to the treatment strategy.
TN|PMC5181807_S114|NEG|NEG|There are several limitations in our study.
TP|PMC5181807_S115|POS|POS|First, the study design was a cross-sectional.
TP|PMC5181807_S116|POS|POS|Thus, nothing conclusive for the association of AI and smoking habits can be stated.
TP|PMC5181807_S117|POS|POS|Prospective studies are needed to investigate the role of AI in smokers, especially in the aspects of mortality or cardiovascular events.
TP|PMC5181807_S118|POS|POS|Second, from the multiple correlation coefficients, the significant 6 factors (as shown in Table 6) explained only 5.0% of the variation of AI.
TP|PMC5181807_S119|POS|POS|Third, we obtained the number of cigarettes by questionnaires, which might not be quantitatively accurate.
TP|PMC5181807_S120|POS|POS|Moreover, we do not have the detailed data regarding smoking duration.
TP|PMC5181807_S121|POS|POS|Forth, because the survey conducted in 2009, the data are little old.
TP|PMC5181807_S122|POS|POS|Finally, although medications for hypertension, dyslipidemia, and diabetes were not correlated with AI levels in our analyses, we were not able to exclude the contributions of some therapeutic agents.
TN|PMC5181807_S18|NEG|NEG|During the past 6 decades, lifestyle and eating patterns have been dramatically changes, associated with socioeconomic development,[3] which may affect atherosclerosis development.[4,5]
TN|PMC5181807_S25|NEG|NEG|However, no study has focused on the effects of dose-dependency of current smoking, including smoking cessation, on arterial stiffness using AI in a general population.
TN|PMC5181807_S40|NEG|NEG|The nonsmokers were defined as no past or current history of smoking, the former smokers as smoking cessation before the examination, and the current smokers as smoking at least 1 cigarette a day.
TN|PMC5181807_S42|NEG|NEG|BP was measured in the supine position twice at 3-minute intervals using an upright standard sphygmomanometer.
TN|PMC5181807_S65|NEG|NEG|Multiple stepwise regression analysis was performed for independent associated factors of AI (Tables 6 and 7).
TN|PMC5181807_S78|NEG|NEG|Systolic (P < 0.001) and diastolic (P < 0.001) BPs, HDL-cholesterol (P = 0.048), FPG (P = 0.023; inversely), smoking habits (P = 0.035).
TN|PMC5181807_S81|NEG|NEG|AI levels in females were significantly and independently associated with age (P < 0.001), systolic BP (P < 0.001), FPG (inversely; P = 0.011), and smoking habits (P = 0.027).
TN|PMC5181807_S92|NEG|NEG|The correlation between AI levels and BMI has been inconsistent.
TN|PMC5181807_S99|NEG|NEG|Recently, smoking in men has been more common in Asia than in the United Kingdom and United State of America, which is opposite in women.[26]
TN|PMC5181808_S11|NEG|NEG|NAR was not associated with HCC recurrence or liver-related mortality in multivariate analysis.
TN|PMC5181808_S114|NEG|NEG|Here, we evaluated the effect of AR for a solitary HCC <5 cm that was limited to a specific tumor location (segments 6 and 7).
TN|PMC5181808_S130|NEG|NEG|Among the patients with intrahepatic recurrence, 22 out of the 43 (51.2%) patients in the NAR group experienced recurrence in the right liver lobe, whereas none of the patients in the AR group did.
TN|PMC5181808_S133|NEG|NEG|We consider the risk of recurrence by local dissemination to be negligible, since most HCC recurrences that develop after curative resection are multicentric.
TN|PMC5181808_S147|NEG|NEG|This study did have several limitations.
TP|PMC5181808_S148|POS|POS|First, the data were obtained from a single-center.
TP|PMC5181808_S149|POS|POS|Second, the retrospective design of the study implies that patient population could potentially be biased.
TP|PMC5181808_S150|POS|POS|Third, the sample sizes for the 2 groups were not well-balanced for survival analyses.
TP|PMC5181808_S151|POS|POS|These size limitations may have masked differences in clinical outcomes between the 2 groups.
TP|PMC5181808_S152|POS|POS|Therefore, a sufficiently powered prospective study is required to confirm that NAR result in similar postoperative survival and recurrence rates as AR.
TN|PMC5181808_S48|NEG|NEG|Each surgeon was responsible for deciding between AR and NAR, but limited NAR was generally preferred for small and solitary HCC that was peripherally located or exhibited exophytic growth.
TN|PMC5181808_S57|NEG|NEG|Tumor recurrence and survival data were also recorded.[11]
TN|PMC5181809_S37|NEG|NEG|Pneumoperitoneum was maintained using an air pump (UCR Olympus) and by insufflating carbon dioxide through the air/water channel of the endoscope.
TN|PMC5181809_S48|NEG|NEG|Antibiotic prophylaxis was continued for another 24 hours.
TN|PMC5181809_S71|NEG|NEG|With experience, time taken to locate the cyst was reduced from 22 minutes in the first patient to 5 minutes in the last patient (Table 1).
TN|PMC5181809_S81|NEG|NEG|The most significant problem with the transgastric route is to locate and expose the liver cyst.
FN|PMC5181810_S100|NEG|POS|Specifically, differences in suppression of the CYP2C9 and VKORC1 genes[26] may have resulted in a weakening of LAAR metabolism and an increase in the toxic effects, contributing to an increased risk of bleeding and coagulation.
TP|PMC5181810_S101|POS|POS|Further, the therapeutic dose of vitamin K1 was limited to 10 to 120 mg/d (intravenous dose q.d.), and the lowest concentration of monotherapy for brodifacoum was 5 ng/mL.
FP|PMC5181810_S102|POS|NEG|There is no further research available on higher or lower therapeutic doses.
TP|PMC5181810_S103|POS|POS|Finally, only some clinical phenomena were explained, and the therapeutic strategies were investigated by a multifactor regression analysis in this study; therefore, the mechanisms behind these phenomena remain unclear.
TP|PMC5181810_S104|POS|POS|These results were interpreted based on inferences through published reports, clinical experience, and regression analysis of the data.
TP|PMC5181810_S105|POS|POS|The results of this study may be attributable to a lack of competitive inhibition between the LAARs and vitamin K1.
FP|PMC5181810_S106|POS|NEG|After successive administration, the distribution of vitamin K1 reached a steady state, and only a small amount of vitamin K1 was required for maintenance treatment.
FN|PMC5181810_S107|NEG|POS|However, successive administrations greater than the minimum dosage resulted in interference (Gunja et al[18] and this study).
TN|PMC5181810_S18|NEG|NEG|Clinical examination[8,9] showed that LAARs can significantly prolong prothrombin time (PT) and activated partial thromboplastin time (APTT).
TN|PMC5181810_S19|NEG|NEG|The treatment for anticoagulant rodenticide poisoning[5] primarily includes administration of vitamin K1, fresh frozen plasma (FFP), prothrombin complex, and recombinant coagulation factor VIIa.
TN|PMC5181810_S24|NEG|NEG|Because LAARs are highly lipid soluble,[13] the measured half-life of rodenticides in vivo tends to be extremely long,[14,15] with an average treatment time of approximately 168 days.[7]
TN|PMC5181810_S31|NEG|NEG|Ultimately, 24 cases were included (9 female and 15 male), with an average age of 40.42 ± 19.19 years as shown in Fig. 1.
TN|PMC5181810_S37|NEG|NEG|A maintenance treatment was then initiated, and the type of anticoagulant rodenticide was determined.
TN|PMC5181810_S44|NEG|NEG|For binary outcomes, we conducted a nonparametric Wilcoxon rank test.
TN|PMC5181810_S45|NEG|NEG|Based on the above results, a robust multifactor regression analysis was continuously performed on the selected independent variables (P < 0.05).
TN|PMC5181810_S51|NEG|NEG|Table 1 shows baseline characteristics of patients, and Table 2 shows toxicant concentration, hemostasis, coagulation indices, and dosage of vitamin K1 (all of which correspond to the time when blood and urine samples were taken), as well as the patients’ VKSTT (the time from the first day after vitamin K1 was administered until the time of toxicant detection in blood and urine) and prehospital time (the exact time of poisoning or 3 days before the onset of first symptoms[17]).
TN|PMC5181810_S57|NEG|NEG|Correlations between vitamin K1 and variables such as age, brodifacoum exposure, bromadiolone exposure, VKSTT, and prehospital time were analyzed by the Spearman rank correlation test.
TN|PMC5181810_S84|NEG|NEG|Consequently, the results of those case studies provide little information for establishing guidelines, with the primary outcome being a threshold value of 10 ng/mL brodifacoum; once the concentration of brodifacoum reached less than the 10 ng/mL threshold, vitamin K1 treatment could be stopped.
TN|PMC5181810_S98|NEG|NEG|This study has certain limitations.
TP|PMC5181810_S99|POS|POS|Genetic differences among patients were not considered in these analyses.
TN|PMC5181812_S17|NEG|NEG|Several cases of consumption coagulopathy induced by a left atrial thrombus have been reported, but none met the criteria for DIC.[6,7]
TN|PMC5181812_S50|NEG|NEG|Abdominal and vascular ultrasonography showed no significant abnormities.
TN|PMC5181812_S52|NEG|NEG|Warfarin was prescribed at 3 mg/d, and anticoagulation therapy with enoxaparin was coadministered at 6000 U/d after ruling out the presence of a deep hematoma and active hemorrhage.
TN|PMC5181812_S71|NEG|NEG|However, considering the complexities of this case and risks of reoperation, our patient decided not to undergo cardiac surgery but to instead continue with anticoagulant therapy comprising low-molecular-weight heparin and warfarin with a goal INR of 2.5.
FN|PMC5181813_S154|NEG|POS|However, individuals who visited the SNUH GC for health screening examinations reside predominantly in the urban area, which was not adjusted in this study.
TN|PMC5181813_S35|NEG|NEG|In SNUH GC, there were approximately 30,000 screening subjects per year.
TN|PMC5181813_S5|NEG|NEG|A total of 21,745 asymptomatic individuals who underwent abdominal computed tomography (CT) as a health screening examination were enrolled between 2003 and 2013 at the Seoul National University Hospital Healthcare System Gangnam Center.
TN|PMC5181813_S51|NEG|NEG|Contrast enhancement was automatically calculated by placing the region-of-interest cursor over the vessel of interest, that is, the abdominal aorta, and the level of the trigger threshold was set at an increase of 100 Hounsfield units.
TN|PMC5181814_S23|NEG|NEG|First, we considered ischemic heart disease or pulmonary thromboembolism due to cancer.
TN|PMC5181814_S36|NEG|NEG|There was no tumor in the right atrium, inferior vena cava, liver, and any other site (Fig. 5).
TN|PMC5181814_S5|NEG|NEG|The echocardiogram showed a tumor located in the right ventricle.
TN|PMC5181814_S59|NEG|NEG|The present report describes an unusual case of isolated metastasis of HCC in the right ventricle.
TN|PMC5181815_S22|NEG|NEG|The PEComa tumor family includes classic epithelioid angiomyolipoma (AML), lymphangioleiomyomatosis, pulmonary and extrapulmonary clear-cell “sugar” tumors, and PEComa.[5–8]
TN|PMC5181815_S72|NEG|NEG|When injecting a sulfur hexafluoride microbubble as a contrast medium of the enhanced ultrasonography, the lesions appeared clearly hypervascular during the arterial phase and isoechoic in the portal phase, and hyperechogenicity in the equilibrium phase.[18]
TN|PMC5181815_S86|NEG|NEG|Positive immunostaining for melanocytic markers (HMB-45 and/or melan-A) and smooth muscle (actin and/or desmin) are the most histological findings.
TN|PMC5181815_S95|NEG|NEG|Keeping enough margin during the surgical resection is considered as the gold standard for the treatment of hepatic PEComa.[31]
TN|PMC5181816_S11|NEG|NEG|Our findings suggest that the MTHFR 677T variant may contribute to the risk of CD in non-Ashkenazi but not Ashkenazi Jews.
TN|PMC5181816_S24|NEG|NEG|Indeed, heterogeneity in the risk of IBD-associated loci among different populations has been described for several important IBD loci.
TN|PMC5181816_S39|NEG|NEG|The subjects and the controls were divided to 2 subgroups by ethnicity (Ashkenazi and non-Ashkenazi Jews).
TN|PMC5181816_S6|NEG|NEG|The aim of this study was to examine the association between MTHFR C677T genotype and IBD in the different Jewish populations.
TN|PMC5181817_S104|NEG|NEG|Moreover, there were no significant differences shown between the 2 groups in each 7 independent sleep component at any 3 time points: preoperatively, 1 m and 12 m postoperatively (all P > 0.05).
TN|PMC5181817_S24|NEG|NEG|The dim light at night promotes melatonin secretion which keeps people sleep, whereas the high intensity of light at daytime, especially blue light inhibits melatonin secretion which keeps people awake.
TN|PMC5181817_S89|NEG|NEG|Then, how the BF-IOL implantation will affect the quality of sleep in the cataract patient after surgery with comparing to their preoperative quality of sleep?
TN|PMC5181817_S94|NEG|NEG|There would be 2 reasons for the improvement on the quality of sleep in the BF-IOL group after the cataract surgery.
TN|PMC5181818_S12|NEG|NEG|In the total population, male patients with primary AS referred higher permanent work disability (13.2% vs 6.9%; P < 0.05), although no difference was observed in psoriatic or IBD spondylitis according to the gender.
TN|PMC5181818_S27|NEG|NEG|Women report more frequent peripheral joint involvement and more functional disability, whereas the male gender is associated with axial involvement and more severe radiographic damage.[7,8]
TN|PMC5181818_S65|NEG|NEG|Among primary AS patients, besides the common characteristics shown by the whole male SpA group, BASRI spine scores were also higher in men compared to women (mean BASRI spine 7.3 vs 5.8; P =  < 0.001).
TN|PMC5181818_S87|NEG|NEG|In the present study, although women referred worse functional involvement and quality of life, male patients presented higher work disability, similar to what has been observed in the North-American PSOAS cohort.[35]
FP|PMC5181819_S146|POS|NEG|This method also generally includes people with above-average health awareness.
FP|PMC5181819_S148|POS|NEG|More iterations may provide us with the ability to capture more accurate temporal variations, which may warrant future research to verify our findings.
TN|PMC5181819_S80|NEG|NEG|The county-level difference was calculated by subtracting the adherence rate in 2008 from the rate in 2012.
TN|PMC5181819_S89|NEG|NEG|Sensitivity analyses using ACS guideline for colorectal cancer and USPSTF recommendation for mammography screening were conducted.
TN|PMC5181820_S113|NEG|NEG|On the other hand, the majority of late recurrences are attributable to new lesions and those patients with recurrence are due to de novo oncogenesis which can be expected to benefit from curative treatment.[2,14]
TN|PMC5181820_S117|NEG|NEG|The likelihood of recurrent HCC detection differed in subsequent surveillance according to the prior surveillance modality.
TN|PMC5181820_S66|NEG|NEG|In patients with cirrhosis, the diagnosis of HCC was made when the tumor was same or larger than 2 cm and at least one of the dynamic enhancement CT or MRI showed a vascular pattern typical of HCC, irrespective of AFP level.
TN|PMC5181820_S74|NEG|NEG|Continuous variables were compared parametrically using Student t test or nonparametrically using the Mann–Whitney U test.
TN|PMC5181821_S109|NEG|NEG|An electronic colonoscopy revealed mucosal congestion and edema of the whole large intestine (Fig. 4A).
TN|PMC5181821_S175|NEG|NEG|Copy numbers per microgram of genomic DNA were calculated from a standard curve of 10-fold serial dilutions of purified CAR plasmid containing 102 to 108 copies/μL.
TN|PMC5181821_S30|NEG|NEG|T-cells can be modified genetically to express anti-CD19 CARs on their surface and have been shown to exert cytotoxic effects against CD19-positive B-cells.
TN|PMC5181821_S98|NEG|NEG|Then, anti-CD19 CAR T-cells were infused at a total dose of 1.0 × 106 CAR-positive T-cells/kg (transduction efficiency was 30%) in a single dose.
TN|PMC5181822_S125|NEG|NEG|Sputum PTX3 levels showed significant positive correlations with serum total IgE, ECP, and eosinophil counts in the blood and sputum, which are well-known biomarkers of atopic status, asthma severity, and eosinophilic airway.[21,22]
TN|PMC5181822_S127|NEG|NEG|Although FEV1 has been considered an objective and reproducible value for measuring airway obstruction, FEV1 is often normal even in children with uncontrolled asthma.[23,24]
TN|PMC5181822_S136|NEG|NEG|Sputum PTX3 levels showed significant negative correlations with FEV1, FEV1/FVC ratio, and FEF25–75 and a positive correlation with BDR.
TN|PMC5181822_S9|NEG|NEG|Sputum PTX3 concentration was significantly higher in children with asthma than in control subjects (P < 0.001).
